            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Paris,</hi> to have his Declaration Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and to give ≈øome Mortification to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The King being arriv'd at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> ≈øent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Parliament to come thither in a Body on foot. The Parliament obeyed, and were conducted to the Gallery which joyns the Tuilleries with the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where they found the King under a Canopy rai≈øed up for that purpo≈øe. The Lord Keeper Spoke fir≈øt; and after the fir≈øt Ceremonies were over, told the Parliament, That their Power extended onely to the Affairs of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, and not to matters of State, the cogni≈øance of which belonged to the Supreme Governour: That where a Prince, or Duke, or any Officer of the Crown, receives his Trial for any Mi≈ødemeanour in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration of the Trea≈øury, or of State-Affairs, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty is obliged, either to direct a particular Commi≈ø≈øion to the Parliament, to enable them to Act in ≈øuch a ca≈øe; or el≈øe to be pre≈øent him≈øelf Per≈øonally, to Authorize the≈øe extraordinary Proceedings: That it is true indeed, that to Judge by a Commi≈ø≈øion required a previous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Cau≈øe, but that in the ca≈øe of Ratifying a Declaration, which always allows a certain time to tho≈øe that are Guilty to return to their Duty, there was no need of farther Deliberation. This was as much as to ≈øay, That the King was willing to make u≈øe of the Parliamentary Authority, to de≈øtroy with more formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tho≈øe who favoured his Brother; but would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Parliament the Power of Clearing them if they were innocent.</p>

                  <hi>Chateaunouf</hi>'s Di≈øcour≈øe being ended, the King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Regi≈øter of the Parliament to be brought to him, and the Leafe to be ≈øhewed where the Vote of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was Written, and ≈øo tore it him≈øelf to pieces, to have the Decree of the Council in≈øerted in its place, which Prohibited the Court of Parliament to Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any more upon the Declarations, concerning State-Affairs, upon pain of Interdiction to the Coun≈øellors, and of ≈øomething wor≈øe, as the King ≈øhould think fit. 'Twas likewi≈øe Ordered, That for a Puni≈øhment of the Fault committed by the Parliament, the Declaration ≈øent to them ≈øhould be drawn back, and they Prohibited to take any knowledge of the Contents thereof. For a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his Indignation, the King Su≈øpended from their Office, and Exiled two Pre≈øidents of the Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt, and a Coun≈øellor, who were neverthele≈øs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after re-e≈øtabli≈øhed. The ≈øame day the Council pa≈øs'd another Sentence again≈øt the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi>'s Attorney, who Pre≈øented the before-mentioned Petition;

The King him≈øelf was be≈øet with People devoted to the Cardinal, who≈øe continual bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs it was to entertain him in an Ill Humour again≈øt his neare≈øt Friends and Relations; and as he beheld nothing but by the Eyes of other People, both his Mother and Brother appeared as Guilty before him, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the Cardinal to repre≈øent them.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54967:6"/>Queen-Mother, and that he favoured the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It was for this Rea≈øon that <hi>Gondi,</hi> who had been at <hi>Florence</hi> for ≈øome time about his own private Affairs; at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>France,</hi> in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders immediately to be gone, and had much ado to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Permi≈ø≈øion to ≈øtay. Once as he had Audience of the Cardinal, this Mini≈øter gave him a long Narrative of the Di≈øcontents of the Queen-Mother, and of all that had pa≈øs'd between them ever ≈øince the Beginning. <q>He a≈ø≈øured him, that he had never given her any Occa≈øion to be angry with him, but that ≈øhe had fallen into a Pa≈ø≈øion upon Trifles; and that by ≈øuffering her ≈øelf to be too much influenced by ≈øome People who de≈øired nothing ≈øo much as to cau≈øe Di≈øturbances at Court, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to cultivate their own particular Intere≈øt, ≈øhe had for≈øaken the King to embrace the Party of the younge≈øt of her Sons; that he (the Cardinal) was willing to withdraw him≈øelf, to take away all occa≈øion of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in the Royal Family; but that the King would not permit him to do it, not believing him≈øelf to be ≈øafe without him, and not thinking fit he ≈øhould have ≈øo much Conde≈øcen≈øion for tho≈øe who had dealt with him ≈øo unworthily: ≈øo that having been thus forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at Court, he was willing, both as a Chri≈øtian, and as one that had infinite Obligations to Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties, to reconcile them together, that he might avoid thereby the Nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øerving the King again≈øt his Mother; that not being con≈øcious to him≈øelf of having ever offended this Prince≈øs, he had de≈øired of her, that ≈øhe would be plea≈øed to tell him what Rea≈øons ≈øhe had to complain of him, and even to ≈øuppo≈øe, if ≈øhe would, any Wrong, which he had never done her, to ≈øupport what ≈øhe had ≈øaid again≈øt him, becau≈øe he would not contradict her, and if condemned, he was ready to make her any publick Satisfaction for it; but that ≈øhe an≈øwered nothing before the King, but only that ≈øhe would never be reconciled to him; that the Wrong which ≈øhe complained to have been done to her, was that which ≈øhe ≈øaid the Cardinal had done both to the King and State: That he had ≈øerved her, during four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years, with all po≈ø≈øible Fidelity and Zeal; but that being fallen out with him, ≈øhe would not hearken to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54967:7"/>any Accommodation, and ≈øought every day an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to have him murther'd; which obliged him to take care for the Pre≈øervation both of his Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and therefore he had not rejected the King's mo≈øt gracious Offers made to him to change tho≈øe Mini≈øters who did not plea≈øe him: That the Queen was never a Pri≈øoner, and that to ≈øatisfie her that ≈øhe was free, they had removed the Soldiers that were about her: That ≈øhe was to be blamed for retiring into <hi>Spain,</hi> and that Animo≈øities were now grown to ≈øuch a degree, that the King could not be reconciled with ≈øafety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Di≈øcour≈øe made <hi>Gondi</hi> believe the ≈øame thing, which ≈øeveral Per≈øons had already ≈øu≈øpected; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Cardinal knew that the Queen had a mind to retire, and therefore was glad to leave her the means to effect it, that ≈øo he might have an Occa≈øion to accu≈øe her of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to hinder the People from being offended at her Bani≈øhment. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Prince≈øs, which was linked with that of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur,</hi> was extremely weak, as wanting both Friends and Money. The Severities u≈øed again≈øt their Followers kept back a great many others who would have otherwi≈øe joyned with them; nor cou'd the Queen-Mother borrow any Money upon her Jewels, becau≈øe People feared that the King wou'd demand them again, as belonging to the Crown. The King on his ≈øide was ≈øo incen≈øed again≈øt his Mother, that there was no likelihood he would tru≈øt her again, as well by rea≈øon of her Corre≈øpondence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as becau≈øe ≈øhe had declared her ≈øelf for the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who ≈øhe believed would infallibly ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Throne after the King's Death, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Predictions, was to happen very ≈øoon. To confirm the King in this ill Humour again≈øt his Mother, an exact Enquiry was made after tho≈øe Per≈øons whom the Queen had con≈øulted to Calculate his Maje≈øty's Nativity, and <hi>Senel,</hi> Phy≈øician to the King, and <hi>Du Val,</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Galleys, for having examined it, and made ≈øini≈øter Predictions again≈øt the Life of his Maje≈øty.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had always entertained a great Corre≈øpondence with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to engage him into his Party; and this Prince rai≈øed ≈øome Troops, with an Intention either to take ≈øome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54967:7"/>Advantage of the pre≈øent Di≈øturbances, or to put him≈øelf in a Condition of Defence again≈øt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who threatned to invade his Dominions. The Cardinal, who was no Friend to the <hi>Hou≈øe of Lorrain,</hi> and who feared it would ≈øupport the Party of <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> took this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to cau≈øe a Declaration of War to be publi≈øhed again≈øt it. The King ≈øent the Mare≈øchals <hi>La Force</hi> and <hi>Schomberg</hi> into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with an Army, and order'd them to take divers Places depending upon the Bi≈øhopricks of <hi>Mets, Toul,</hi> and of <hi>Verdun,</hi> which they ≈øaid had been u≈øurped by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> but above all, to attack <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envic,</hi> which the Emperour had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed him≈øelf of by the Coun≈øel, Advice, and A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of this Prince.</p>
               <p>Both the King and the Cardinal de≈øigned to go per≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally thither, but before they went, they re≈øolved to ≈øee the Declarations again≈øt tho≈øe that e≈øpou≈øed the Party of the Queen-Mother, put in Execution. The Court fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if they ≈øhould remit it to the Parliament, this Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution would go but heavily on, becau≈øe the Parliament acted only again≈øt their Wills, and the u≈øual Formalities ought to be ob≈øerved. Be≈øides the Inju≈øtice of proceeding otherwi≈øe, it was dangerous too violently to countenance the Pa≈ø≈øions of the Mini≈øter again≈øt <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> who becau≈øe the King was then without I≈ø≈øue, was look'd upon as the next Heir to the Crown. So the Cardinal, who never loved the ancient Proceedings but when they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him, ≈øo managed matters, that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to con≈øtitute a Chamber of Ju≈øtice to proceed with Rigour again≈øt tho≈øe who favoured his Mother and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and e≈øpecially again≈øt ≈øuch as had retired with them out of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Parliament refu≈øed to own the Declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the e≈øtabli≈øhing of this new Chamber, unle≈øs the Members that ≈øhould compo≈øe it were all taken out of their Body. The King ≈øent to them thereupon a ≈øpecial Command, to oblige them to let fall this Oppo≈øition; and the Parliament were contented to ask that the <hi>Sub≈øtitute</hi> and the <hi>Regi≈øter</hi> of that Chamber ≈øhould be taken out of their Company. But the Mini≈øter, being not willing that any one ≈øhould be enabled either to clear or to delay the Condemnation of tho≈øe whom he had a mind to de≈øtroy, engaged the King to e≈øtabli≈øh, by his Letters Patent, this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54967:8"/>Chamber in the Ar≈øenal<note n="*" place="margin">The 23th of <hi>September 1631.</hi>
                  </note>, and to admit none into it that were of the Parliament, but only two Coun≈øellors of State, ≈øix Ma≈øters of the Reque≈øts, and as many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øellors of the Grand Council.

               <p>In the mean time the Parliament ≈øeeing their Authority would fall at la≈øt to nothing, and that no body's Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence would be ≈øecure from the exce≈ø≈øive Power of the Mini≈øter, if once it was grown a Cu≈øtom to act by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Proceedings; ≈øummon'd an A≈ø≈øembly of all the Chambers<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">The 28th of <hi>Novemb.</hi>

The mo≈øt difficult Treaty was that of <hi>Quera≈øque,</hi> which was manag'd by <hi>Matthias Galas</hi> for the Emperour, and by the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Thoiras</hi> and <hi>Servien</hi> for the King of <hi>France.</hi> The Nuncio interpo≈øed as Mediator, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was there pre≈øent in per≈øon.

The time ≈øpecified in the la≈øt Treaty being at hand, <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Briqueras</hi> were re≈øtored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Pa≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> quitted by the <hi>Imperiali≈øts.</hi> All the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> except <hi>Porto</hi> and <hi>Canetto,</hi> was ≈øurrendred to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> withdrew from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and from <hi>Savoy,</hi> while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> On the 15th of <hi>September Su≈øa</hi> and <hi>Avilliana</hi> were re≈øtored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy, Porto</hi> and <hi>Canetto</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> On the 23d the <hi>Germans</hi> departed out of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> at lea≈øt it was thought ≈øo. After which the Pope relea≈øed the Ho≈øtages.</p>
               <p>All things were ≈øeemingly in a perfect Peace, when it appeared that on all ≈øides they onely thought how to deceive one another. <hi>Victor Amadeo</hi> had a long while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de≈øign'd to make his Peace with <hi>France,</hi> which had got already a con≈øiderable part of his State; and <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> who was aware of it, gave him to under≈øtand, that if he de≈øired to engage wholly this Crown in his Intere≈øt, and to remove all Su≈øpicions on his part, he ought to give to His Maje≈øty an a≈ø≈øured Pledge of his Good Will, ≈øuch as <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and that the King would not be wanting to Recompence him another way.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> was ≈øo ≈øtrongly of opinion, that this Place was nece≈ø≈øary to the Crown, that he could not re≈øolve to have it re≈øtored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever inconveniences might ari≈øe from the contrary. Mo≈øt part of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes confirmed him in the≈øe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the ≈øecret Sollicitations of their Mini≈øters to that purpo≈øe. They were glad that <hi>France</hi> ≈øhould have a Door open to enter <hi>Italy,</hi> when occa≈øion ≈øhould require, to have a Foreign Army to Counter-ballance the exce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive Power of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> By complying thus with their de≈øires, <hi>France</hi> would recover their Friend≈øhip, lo≈øt by the Peace of <hi>Lions</hi> (in 1601.) by which they quitted to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the Marqui≈øate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently gave up the Pa≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Alpes;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King's Authority grew ≈øo much the greater, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54967:10"/>the Power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was more le≈ø≈øen'd. Be≈øides, the Cardinal could not leave behind him a more Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrious Monument of his good Conduct, than a place of this Importance, which was formerly quitted by <hi>Henry</hi> the III. to the Dukes of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Difficulty was how to find a way to keep it, without breaking the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> but it could not be done again≈øt the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Con≈øent. Therefore the Cardinal, who had already a great E≈øteem for <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and knew that he was likewi≈øe well-accepted by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> charged him with this Negotiation, which he perform'd to his Satisfaction. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having con≈øented to leave <hi>Pignerol</hi> in the hands of <hi>France,</hi> they got him (be≈øides what was promi≈øed to him) the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Canaves,</hi> which was di≈ømembred from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Quera≈øque,</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Imperiali≈øts,</hi> who knew nothing of the Negotiation concerning <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which was kept ≈øecret, were ≈øurpri≈øed, that <hi>France</hi> ≈øhould ≈øpoil the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> their Ally, to ≈øerve the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had taken Arms again≈øt them; but time di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the My≈øtery. No noi≈øe was to be made about it, before <hi>Mantua</hi> was Re≈øtored; the Pa≈ø≈øages of the Country of the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> remitted to their Ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters, and the Ho≈øtages relea≈øed; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had a vi≈øible Intere≈øt in keeping the <hi>French</hi> on the other ≈øide of the Mountains, would certainly have broken the Treaty, rather than permitted <hi>Pignerol</hi> to remain in their hands.</p>
               <p>It was therefore nece≈ø≈øary ≈øo to order Affairs, that if the <hi>French</hi> quitted the Place, in Compliance to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they ≈øhould be ≈øecure of returning into it again. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> promi≈øed to do it after the Execution of the Treaty; and, for a Pledge of his Word, ≈øent the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> his Brothers, into <hi>France,</hi> under pretence that they were to pa≈øs into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> But the Cardinal feared, lea≈øt this Prince, to whom this Place was, at lea≈øt, as Important as it was to <hi>France,</hi> would not be as good as his Word, ≈øince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would infallibly be ready to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, in this occa≈øion, with all their Forces. Therefore they labour'd to find
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54967:11"/>out ≈øome Stratagem or other to ≈øecure them≈øelves of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ≈øtill in the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> though at the ≈øame time they made a ≈øhew of quitting it, ≈øo that no body ≈øhould perceive it: This difficult bu≈øine≈øs was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Marque≈øs of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who carried it on in ≈øuch a manner, that he deceived not onely the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and the <hi>Piedmontois,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>He pick'd out Three hundred Men, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to tru≈øt with a Secret Order he had lately recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the King, which was, to ≈øend them with all ≈øpeed to the Cittadel of <hi>Ca≈øal,</hi> and commanded them to ≈øend away their Baggage with the re≈øt of the Garri≈øon, who were di≈øpo≈øing them≈øelves to clear the Place at the time prefixt, being about Three thou≈øand Men in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to take their way to <hi>Dauphine.</hi> In the mean time he cau≈øed them to hide them≈øelves in ≈øeveral ≈øecret holes of the Ca≈øtle, and particularly in an old Garret, where was a long time ago a Door Wall'd up, adjoyning to the Dungeon. <hi>Villeroy</hi> cau≈øed this Garret to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Partition of Boards, and at one ≈øide Corn to be laid up; and, on the other ≈øide, where the Wall'd-door was, lay part of his Men. But becau≈øe this would have met with very much difficulty in the Execution, if many <hi>Piedmontois</hi> had been in the Place; he cau≈øed a Report to be ≈øpread abroad, That the Plague was at <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and particularly in the Cittadel; which put a ≈øtop to the curio≈øity of the People from flocking thither, and al≈øo to the ≈øpeedy Levies which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> intended to make there for the Garri≈øon. The Count of <hi>Verrue,</hi> ≈øent by the Duke to Receive the Place, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Secret, but the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Commi≈ø≈øioners had not the lea≈øt ≈øu≈øpicion of it. As ≈øoon as they were arriv'd, they ≈øaw the <hi>French</hi> Troops go out in a File towards <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> took care him≈øelf to Conduct them to all the Magazines, affecting in this an extraordinary Punctuality, to tire them, and get time, which ≈øucceeded ≈øo much the ea≈øier, becau≈øe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners were unwilling to enter any place that had not been before purifi'd with Fire and Sweet Odours, for fear of catching the Plague. Being entred the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, where the Three hundred Souldiers were hid, the Marque≈øs deliver'd up the Gate to the Count of <hi>Verrue,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54967:11"/>who committed it to Fifty or Three≈øcore Souldiers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of an Officer; after which he drew the Garri≈øon out, and led the Commi≈ø≈øioners to every part of it. The Count had with him a Colonel of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> named <hi>Porporati,</hi> who knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Secret, looked into every Corner with a great deal of Care; ≈øo that <hi>Villeroy,</hi> fearing lea≈øt he ≈øhould di≈øcover the place where mo≈øt part of his Men were hid, gave a Jog to the Count, and turning him≈øelf to the Commi≈ø≈øioners, told them, That it being already pretty late, they would do well to ≈øend ≈øome body to vi≈øit the Fort of St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and this Commi≈ø≈øion was given to <hi>Porporati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal was ≈øo entirely re≈øolv'd not to abandon the Cittadel of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> that <hi>Villeroy</hi> had Orders to Impri≈øon the Commi≈ø≈øioners, in ca≈øe they ≈øhould di≈øcover the Cheat; and, for this effect, he had along with him Ten or Twelve of the mo≈øt ≈øtrong and re≈øolute Fellows, to put his Orders in Execution at the fir≈øt ≈øign.</p>
               <p>This Re≈øolution which could not be put in execution, without a Scandalous Violation of the Treaty of <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasque,</hi> and even of the Law of Nations, ≈øufficiently ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how willing the Cardinal was to keep this Place. By good hap the Commi≈ø≈øioners were not aware of the Cheat, and <hi>Villeroy</hi> got the very ≈øame day an Atte≈øtation from them, by which they acknowledg'd., That <hi>Pignerol</hi> was faithfully deliver'd again into the hands of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards.</hi> He ≈øent it Po≈øt to <hi>Ferrara</hi> to have the Ho≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges relea≈øed.</p>
               <p>Not above four or five Per≈øons were in the Cittadel to look after the Magazines, and the <hi>Piedmontois,</hi> who were at the Gate, had an Order to let no body in, except one Page of the Count of <hi>Verrue,</hi> to entertain them in the opinion that there was no body in the Cittadel: This bu≈øine≈øs la≈øted Two and thirty days, during which the hidden Souldiers did not want Provi≈øions, for they were abundantly provided before.</p>
               <p>Now it was nece≈ø≈øary to draw the≈øe Souldiers out of their holes, and to per≈øwade the World, That they were got in again in ≈øpight of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore they onely look'd for a Pretence, which would not have been ≈øo ea≈øie a thing to find, if the Duke
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54967:12"/>of <hi>Feria,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> had been more quick in executing the Treaty of <hi>Querasque,</hi> who, fearing lea≈øt the <hi>French</hi> would not an≈øwer his hone≈øt and fair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, retained Two <hi>German</hi> Regiments in the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and ≈øome <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Cavalry, whom he had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to di≈ømi≈øs.

               </p>
               <p>The Great Sums of Money which <hi>Spain</hi> was accu≈øed to furni≈øh the Queen-Mother with, did not help a little to heighten the≈øe Complaints, and they were carried to the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> in very high words, purpo≈øely to exa≈øperate the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ≈øome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction or other, which might give occa≈øion to the <hi>French</hi> to ≈øay, That they were con≈øtrained by the Duke's Contraventions, to Po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves again of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol.</hi>

               <p>On his ≈øide <hi>Feria</hi> begun likewi≈øe to complain of the <hi>French,</hi> becau≈øe the Garri≈øons of <hi>Mantua</hi> and of <hi>Ca≈øal</hi> were full of Souldiers of their Nation, and the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> Fortified the Pa≈ø≈øage of <hi>Steich,</hi> again≈øt the Treaty of <hi>Monzon.</hi> He Publi≈øh'd a Writing, in which he expos'd at length the Infractions which he thought the <hi>French</hi> had made again≈øt that of <hi>Quera≈øque,</hi> and ≈øaid, <hi>That they might be followed with greater Inconveniencies.</hi> The Mini≈øters of <hi>France</hi> who ≈øought after a Quarrel, took up the≈øe words, as if the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> had meant, That as ≈øoon as the <hi>French</hi> Troops were gone out of <hi>Italy,</hi> he would Revenge him≈øelf of tho≈øe Infractions he imputed to them. Furthermore, they had notice, that the Emperour, at the In≈øtance of <hi>Spain,</hi> had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red void the Inve≈øtiture ≈øent to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> ≈øhould be exactly ob≈øerved; and thereupon the <hi>French</hi> gave out, That the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had a De≈øign to Invade a-new the States of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this they di≈øper≈øed a Manife≈øto, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> though they complained of him in publick, in which, after great Complaints again≈øt the Unfair Dealings of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their Allies, and e≈øpecially of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to carry on their Trick
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54967:12"/>more ≈øecretly, they declared, that the King was re≈øolved to ≈øecure the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to protect his Allies there. For this purpo≈øe, <hi>Servien</hi> ask'd the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> to deliver back ≈øeveral Places in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt others, <hi>Pignerol,</hi> for the Reception of the <hi>French</hi> Army which was to pa≈øs thither again. The Mini≈øters of <hi>France</hi> prote≈øted before God and Men, that it was not out of any Ambitious Motive, or to di≈øturb the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> that the King their Ma≈øter demanded the≈øe Places; but on the contrary, to make it more firm, and to give the Allies that Peace, which they de≈øired ≈øo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly to enjoy.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ≈øo carried him≈øelf, as if he thought this Demand very ≈øtrange, and told <hi>Servien</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons he had to deny it; but <hi>Servien</hi> replied, That if he would not grant, of his own free accord, what the King de≈øired, the Army which was in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and in <hi>Provence,</hi> ≈øhould repa≈øs the Mountains by force, for the Security of his Allies. He allowed the Duke Three Days to con≈øider of it, after which he threatned him, in ca≈øe of Denial, with the Inva≈øion both of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi> In the mean while this Prince ≈øent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> with the Preten≈øions of the <hi>French,</hi> and to Ask Succours of him to oppo≈øe this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Inva≈øion. The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> offered him all the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance which was in his Power. When they came to the Particulars, this Prince Ask'd for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Savoy</hi> Ten thou≈øand Foot, and a Thou≈øand Hor≈øe, and half that number for <hi>Piedmont,</hi> be≈øides his own Troops. He thought this would ≈øuffice for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, ≈øince Winter was ≈øo near. He de≈øired al≈øo that <hi>Spain</hi> ≈øhould immediately Pay him off all the Arrears due to him, which His Catholick Maje≈øty had Promi≈øed him, after which, they might at lea≈øure Di≈øcour≈øe of what was Nece≈ø≈øary to be done for the future. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> knew that it was impo≈ø≈øible for the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to ≈øatisfie his Demands, and he made them on purpo≈øe, that they ≈øhould not think it ≈øtrange if he delivered <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> ≈øeeing they were not in a condition to Protect him again≈øt them. The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> An≈øwered, That he would immediately ≈øupply him with what Help he could, and that as ≈øoon as the New
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54967:13"/>Levies were made in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> he would ≈øend them with all ≈øpeed to him. In the mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> offered to enter into Negotiation with the <hi>French</hi> upon this matter, but <hi>Servien</hi> would not hearken to it before the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had An≈øwered his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, To deceive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> effectually, the Duke A≈ø≈øembled<note n="*" place="margin">The 19th of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </note> his Council, in which it was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That ≈øince he could not hope to receive from them the Succours he wanted, to defend him≈øelf again≈øt the <hi>French,</hi> it was better to come to an Agreement, and, of two Evils, to choo≈øe the lea≈øt. The Dutche≈øs of <hi>Savoy</hi> feigned likewi≈øe to interpo≈øe with her Brother for the Moderation of the Demands which <hi>Servien</hi> had made. They agreed afterwards upon the≈øe Articles; That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ≈øhould neither directly nor indirectly help tho≈øe who would endeavour to cau≈øe any Di≈øturbance in <hi>France</hi> during the Ab≈øence of the Queen-Mother, and of the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> That he ≈øhould grant free Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage to the <hi>French</hi> Troops, in ca≈øe there ≈øhould be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity to ≈øend them again into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> or the Peace came to be di≈øturbed on the ≈øide of the <hi>Gri≈øons,</hi> or of <hi>Mantua:</hi> That to give a Pledge to the <hi>French</hi> King that he would keep his Word, he ≈øhould depo≈øite the Town and Cittadel of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> with the Three Forts of <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øa,</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Swi≈ø≈øes,</hi> who were intru≈øted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Su≈øa:</hi> That the ≈øame <hi>Swi≈ø≈øes</hi> ≈øhould take an Oath, That they would faithfully keep the≈øe Three Places during Six Months; at the end of which they ≈øhould re≈øtore them to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> unle≈øs the Prince ≈øhould think fit, in ca≈øe the ≈øame Conjunctures happened, to have their Tru≈øt further prolonged: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs, that His Maje≈øty might put a Governour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Place, who ≈øhould take the ≈øame Oath. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with the con≈øent of the Duke, a <hi>French</hi> Garri≈øon was exchang'd with that of the <hi>Swi≈ø≈øes,</hi> and the Three hundred Souldiers came out of the places where they had hid them≈øelves.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> gave notice to Duke <hi>Feria</hi> of the Articles he had Agreed upon with the <hi>French.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> dur≈øt not di≈øapprove wholly the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Conduct, though he thought it would
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54967:13"/>be highly prejudicial to <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus the <hi>French</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to re-enter into the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which they had not quitted; and they afterwards engag'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to yield it up wholly to them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not perceiving (at fir≈øt) the Trick which was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. As the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Mini≈øters in <hi>Italy</hi> were blamed for their want of Conduct, ≈øo it was thought very ≈øtrange, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for ≈øome Lands in <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> which <hi>France</hi> cau≈øed to be given him, by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Quera≈øque,</hi> ≈øhould voluntarily tie up his own hands by parting with <hi>Pignerol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was reduc'd by this War to ≈øuch Extremities, that he depended wholly upon <hi>France,</hi> and dur≈øt not contradict them in the lea≈øt. So that at the ≈øame time that the <hi>French</hi> were bu≈øie to ≈øecure <hi>Pignerol</hi> for them≈øelves, he was oblig'd to permit them to ≈øend a ≈øtrong Garri≈øon to the Cittadel of <hi>Ca≈øal,</hi> for fear the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ≈øeeing the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Pignerol,</hi> ≈øhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make them≈øelves Ma≈øters of it. This bu≈øine≈øs was likewi≈øe carried on with ≈øo much ≈øecrecy, that they knew nothing of it in <hi>Italy,</hi> till after Two <hi>French</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had got into <hi>Ca≈øal.</hi> As ≈øoon as the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, who were jealous of the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> knew that the <hi>French</hi> were in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the≈øe two Places, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the Treaty of <hi>Quera≈øque,</hi> they ≈øhewed in all parts how well they were plea≈øed with it, and e≈øpecially the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were not in favour with the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> and feared its Re≈øentments.

               <p>A little while after, the Deputies of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> came to <hi>Metz,</hi> where the King was.<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">Siri Mem. <hi>Rec.</hi> Tom. 7.

               <p>Mon≈øieur, who was then at <hi>Nancy,</hi> was oblig'd to withdraw, and to retire to the Low-Countries; and the French Army advanc'd to the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> as if they would have favour'd <hi>Gu≈øtavus Adolphus;</hi> though at the bottom, <hi>France</hi> began to grow jealous of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to fear lea≈øt the Emperour and the Catholick League ≈øhould wholly ≈øink under the power of his Arms.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec,</hi> T. 7. Pag. 475.</note> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> de≈øired extreamly to have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. being u≈øed to manage his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations him≈øelf; and the King of <hi>France</hi> ≈øhew'd on his ≈øide a great Inclination to ≈øee <hi>Gu≈øtavus,</hi> for fear of offending him. But this Prince had quite other things in his Thoughts, and dur≈øt not expo≈øe him≈øelf to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, which had turned wholly to the Honour of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to whom he was not to be compar'd for the Qualities either of Body or Mind.</p>
               <p>So a little time after, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the French King being indi≈øpo≈øed, was not in a condition to come to an Interview; therefore it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to him, that he would be plea≈øed to meet Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who was more fit to treat with <hi>Gu≈øtavus</hi> than <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, who referr'd every thing to his Mini≈øter. <hi>Gu≈øtavus,</hi> who was of a ha≈øty Temper, an≈øwered, he would ≈øend one of his Servants to confer with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; that he e≈øteemed him≈øelf not inferiour to the French King, and did not under≈øtand why he ≈øhould decline to meet him; that the <hi>Swedi≈øh</hi> Kings never truckled to tho≈øe of <hi>France;</hi> and that all Crowns were equal.</p>
               <p>The≈øe Expre≈ø≈øions of <hi>Gu≈øtavus,</hi> be≈øides that he was ≈øu≈øpected of a≈øpiring to no le≈øs than an Univer≈øal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, cooled very much the De≈øign which the French had to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, and hinder'd the King, at that time, from declaring openly again≈øt the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria.</hi> Be≈øides, the Cardinal had ≈øome particular Rea≈øons which kept him back from engaging him≈øelf in great Enterpri≈øes, in which <hi>France</hi> might perhaps not always get the better. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Aver≈øion of the Queen-Mother, and of Mon≈øieur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; the hatred even of almo≈øt the whole Kingdom, not to mention the Foreign Powers whom he had mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, and the little Certainty he had that the King, upon who≈øe Affection his Fortune was built, would live long; all this made him very often think of his own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54967:15"/>in ca≈øe any ≈øini≈øter Accident ≈øhould befall him.</p>
               <p>To ≈øhelter him≈øelf again≈øt all Misfortunes, he de≈øign'd at this time to marry his Niece <hi>Combalet</hi> with the Count of <hi>Soi≈ø≈øons,</hi> to whom he made very advantageous Offers. He pretended to put him in a Condition not only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to be a Support to the Relations of his Lady, but al≈øo almo≈øt of giving Laws to the King him≈øelf. The Count con≈øented to it, but was de≈øirous that the King ≈øhould declare in Writing, that he promoted this Marriage as being advantageous both for his Service and the Good of the State; and that for this Rea≈øon he commanded him to marry the Cardinal's Niece. The Mini≈øter, whom the King humoured in all things, thought he might ea≈øily obtain this Favour, and demanded it, though without the return of any po≈øitive An≈øwer. He continued then to treat of this Bu≈øine≈øs him≈øelf, and had his Propo≈øitions carried to the Count of <hi>Soi≈ø≈øons</hi> by his Creatures; but at la≈øt he perceived that this Marriage di≈øplea≈øed the King, becau≈øe he had very good rea≈øon to believe that it would make the Count of <hi>Soi≈ø≈øons</hi> too powerful; that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was an Enemy to the Count, would joyn with the Di≈øaffected; and that con≈øequently the King would find him≈øelf alone with the Count, and draw upon him all the Enemies of the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>This Prelate coming to under≈øtand the Sentiments of his Maje≈øty upon this Affair, ≈øhewed an entire Submi≈ø≈øion to his Will, and gave out that his Niece was going to retire into a Nunnery, though nothing was ≈øo far from her Thoughts. It was ≈øecretly whi≈øper'd to the King, that this Marriage would render the Count of <hi>Soi≈ø≈øons</hi> too greats and that it would utterly di≈øoblige the Queen-Mother and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whom, neither in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, nor even in good Politicks, he could always keep out of the Kingdom. In the mean while the Cardinal, who was u≈øed to Refu≈øals, feared le≈øt the King's Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him ≈øhould change, and he was ob≈øerved to be very ≈øad for ≈øome days.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> weary of publi≈øhing his Prai≈øes without any Advantage to him≈øelf, and angry at the Marriage which was propo≈øed, in≈øtead of going to a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the E≈øtates of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> retired to <hi>Bruges.</hi> In order to hinder him from having any Communication with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54967:15"/>of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Berry,</hi> it was thought nece≈ø≈øary to cau≈øe ≈øome Forces to advance to the River <hi>Loire</hi> to guard the Pa≈ø≈øes. But there was no Nece≈ø≈øity for this Precaution, as a little time made it appear.</p>

But the≈øe, who far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to come and ≈øurrender them≈øelves to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, intended not to go home, unle≈øs they could be con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Gainers by the Bargain, per≈øwaded Mon≈øieur to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the≈øe Offers; and the D. of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who ≈øaw very well that their Return upon the≈øe Conditions would only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe the Authority of the Cardinal, a profe≈ø≈øed Enemy to his Hou≈øe, was the fir≈øt who advi≈øed Mon≈øieur to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Right by force of Arms, and begun him≈øelf to make new Levies again, for fear of being ≈øurpri≈øed as he was before; and ≈øoon after, Mon≈øieur, who was retired to <hi>Flanders,</hi> returned into <hi>Lorrain</hi> with ≈øome Forces, which he joyned with tho≈øe of the Duke.</p>
               <p>Both the King and the Cardinal were gone into <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> to oppo≈øe the Enterpri≈øes of the di≈øaffected Per≈øons, who kept private Corre≈øpondences there.

                  <hi>Bullion</hi> told this Prince, That the be≈øt and onely way he had to obtain what he reque≈øted, was to ≈øubmit him≈øelf wholly to the King's Will; that to de≈øire an a≈ø≈øurance of it, would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to him, and an offence to that Tru≈øt he ought to have in his Clemency; That this being a Pardon which was wholly to redound to the King's Glory, he wrong'd the Duke of <hi>Montmonency,</hi> in not leaving it at His Maje≈øty's Di≈øpo≈øition; that the blind obedience he ≈øhow'd the King upon this occa≈øion, ought to put him out of fear, and give him hopes as certain as he could de≈øire.

               <p>The King, on his ≈øide, granted His Pardon to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur, and to his Dome≈øticks, and moreover to the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> whom he re≈øtored to his E≈øtate, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to re≈øide in one of his Hou≈øes, that ≈øhould be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His Maje≈øty.

As ≈øoon as he was taken, it was debated in a ≈øecret Council what to do with him, and 'tis confidently reported, that care was taken already to incen≈øe the King again≈øt him, by telling him, That they had found about his Arm a Locket of Gold, to which was tied the Picture of a certain Lady in Miniature, for whom His Maje≈øty had a great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. <hi>Pompone de Bilievre</hi> Intendant in Mare≈øchal <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s Army took it dexterou≈øly from him at his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and took the Picture from it; but as this was done in pre≈øence of ≈øeveral per≈øons, notice was given
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54967:21"/>to the Cardinal of it, to exa≈øperate the King again≈øt him. So when the que≈øtion was put, If the King ≈øhould u≈øe the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> ≈øeverely, or forgive him, it was no hard matter to incline him to a rigorous u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage.</p>

               <p>After he had thus produc'd his Rea≈øons in favour of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> the Cardinal turned the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ≈øaid, <q>That on the other ≈øide, if they con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that the King was without Children, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur look'd upon as Pre≈øumptive Heir to the Crown, they would find, that if tho≈øe who followed his Party, were not rigorou≈øly puni≈øh'd; the fir≈øt time the King fell Sick, how incon≈øiderable ≈øoever his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs ≈øhould be, ≈øo many People would declare for the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that the King would not be able to Ma≈øter them: That on the contrary, if the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was brought to De≈øerved Puni≈øhment, no body would dare to engage in ≈øuch Attempts any more; That not a ≈øew Kings, whom he named, had

That Mon≈øieur ≈øubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to the King out of Nece≈ø≈øity, and not out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would prove always the ≈øame, and the Queen-Mother would ≈øtill per≈øi≈øt in her Anger: That <hi>Puilaurens</hi> would have no le≈øs credit with Mon≈øieur than before, and that his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Intreaguing with the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue: So that the danger being over, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> would hearken to bad Coun≈øels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: That if they thought fit to for≈øake the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the Rage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cea≈øe; and if they would Sacrifice to the Queen-Mother all tho≈øe whom ≈øhe hated, and put the King in a total Dependance upon her, her Animo≈øity might likewi≈øe be at an end; but if none of the≈øe things cou'd be done, as really the King could do neither of them without undoing him≈øelf, 'twas certain that the more Mon≈øieur's Party ≈øub≈øi≈øted in the Heads of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54967:22"/>it, the greater the danger wou'd be, by rea≈øon of their continual Cabals, and becau≈øe the danger, when it was once over, was reckon'd for nothing: That the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> being Puni≈øhed, his Party would fall in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and that of Mon≈øieur all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>France;</hi> whereas if he was kept a Pri≈øoner, though never ≈øo many be≈øides were Executed, he would have always ≈øecret Friends, and ≈øo much the more true to him, that they ≈øhould have no other hopes but in his re-≈øtabli≈øhment, which con≈øequently they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure by all ways what≈øoever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards the Cardinal begun to Confute the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons he had at fir≈øt propo≈øed, to favour the Pardon which Men≈øieur demanded for the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</hi> He ≈øaid, <q>That the Promi≈øes which Mon≈øieur made to obtain what he de≈øired, wou'd be indeed con≈øiderable, had he not broken his word three times, though he had been very kindly u≈øed by the King, and ≈øeen all his Hou≈øhold rewarded with extraordinary Favours; but after this it would be imprudently done to tru≈øt him: That if Mon≈øieur could not ≈øave the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Life, he would find fewer People ready to ≈øerve him than if he ≈øaved him; and that this Rea≈øon alone was ≈øufficient for to have him Puni≈øhed: That Mon≈øieur being not able to procure his Pardon, would not ruine him≈øelf, becau≈øe of his Death, and that the nece≈ø≈øity of leaving him to the Severity of his Sentence, wou'd ≈øecure his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øince it is better at la≈øt to have an Arm cut off, than to lo≈øe ones Life: That ≈øuppo≈øe Mon≈øieur ≈øhould pa≈øs into <hi>Spain,</hi> uppon the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puni≈øhed, yet his Power would be ≈øo much Clipp'd, that he would never be able to ≈øet up another Party: That indeed, the Mini≈øters who declar'd for Severity in this occa≈øion, expos'd them≈øelves very much; but when the Service of King and State were called in que≈øtion, they ought not to have any regard to their particular Intere≈øt. La≈øtly, The Cardinal concluded, That to grant the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Life to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur's Reque≈øt, would ≈øtrengthen his Party, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that of the King: neverthele≈øs, the King might Grant it out of His meer Bounty, and not being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54967:23"/>to it by a Treaty; but there was more danger in the doing, than in not doing of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Council yielded to the Cardinal's Advice, which no body ever contradicted Unpuni≈øhed, in Affairs of any moment.

                  </note> who had been ≈øu≈øpected of favouring Mon≈øieur's Party, but had always kept firm to his Duty, though he was a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friend to the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to <hi>Toulou≈øe,</hi> and took upon him≈øelf to go and ≈øpeak to the King, in the Name of all the Relations and Friends of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency.</hi> He kneeled down before him, and the King having bid him ri≈øe up, the Duke of <hi>E≈øpernon,</hi> after having Acknowledg'd the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal's Fault, told him, among≈øt other things, That he was ≈øo much the more embolden'd to beg His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty's mo≈øt Gracious Pardon, that him≈øelf having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the like Favour from his Bounty, in an occa≈øion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt like this, he e≈øteemed him≈øelf very happy, that he had given no occa≈øion to His Maje≈øty to Repent of it: That he was not the onely Man among≈øt His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that lay under the ≈øame obligations: That Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had as great a ≈øhare in it as him≈øelf, that both of them had ≈øided with the Queen-Mother, at a time when the King's Name was contrary to them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54967:24"/>though they had no other intention than to ≈øerve him; and that if he had then abandoned them to the ≈øeverity of the Laws, and of Ju≈øtice, he would have deprived him≈øelf, both of the mo≈øt profitable Services of the one, and of the grateful Acknowledgments of the other: That the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s youth ought to be no le≈øs an excu≈øe to him, than their hone≈øt Intentions had been to them: That his Per≈øon being in the hands of His Maje≈øty, he was not able to do him the lea≈øt Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but his Con≈øervation wou'd be an eternal Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to His Glory. He de≈øired the King to con≈øider, that in this young Duke's Per≈øon alone remained the Great and Illu≈øtrious Name of <hi>Montmorency:</hi> That the high Merits of his Ance≈øtours, who≈øe long Scries ≈øpread as far as the beginning of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, did call more loudly for His Grace, than his ra≈øhne≈øs did for the Severity of the King's Ju≈øtice: That if he was ≈øo happy as to obtain a Second Life for his Friend, he would be his Security, that it ≈øhould be wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Service of His Maje≈øty; and that his blood ≈øhould onely ≈øerve to blot out both the Blackne≈øs and the Memory of his Crime.</p>
               <p>The King heard the Duke of <hi>E≈øpernon</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him; and having ca≈øt his looks towards the ground, from the very beginning of his Speech, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ≈øame po≈øture, and an≈øwered him not one word. The Duke perceived very well by this ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate Silence, that the Cardinal had ≈øo deeply per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King that <hi>Montmorency</hi> ought to die, that it was impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øave him. However he rea≈ø≈øumed his Speech again, and told the King, That ≈øince there was no Pardon to hope for the Duke, he de≈øired him to give him leave to retire. The King an≈øwered, He might do it, and that him≈øelf would not make a long ≈øtay at <hi>Toulou≈øe.</hi>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was ≈øo univer≈øally beloved by every body, and the Cardinal ≈øo univer≈øally hated, that a General appearance of Sorrow<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>As ≈øoon as his Sentence was Read to him, the King ≈øent to him to deliver back the Order of the Holy Gho≈øt, and his Mare≈øchal's Staff, which the Duke ≈øent him back by <hi>De Launai</hi>

All tho≈øe who were in the Clo≈øet did the ≈øame; and the King had the di≈øplea≈øure to ≈øee every body weep about Him; no body but the Cardinal and his Creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to dige≈øt the inflexibility he ≈øhewed upon this occa≈øion.

The onely Favour which the King granted him, was, That the Hangman ≈øhould not Tie him; that his E≈øtate ≈øhould not be Confi≈øcated; and that he ≈øhould be Executed in the Court of the Town-Hall. His Head was Cut off the ≈øame day that his Sentence was pronounced to him; after which the King prepared to take his Journey to <hi>Paris.</hi> 'Twas wondred at, that this Prince, who always yielded to the fir≈øt Accu≈øation which the Cardinal made again≈øt any whom he de≈øired to ruine, had they done never ≈øo great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the State, ≈øhould remain inflexible to all the Sollicitations of the whole Court, and of all <hi>France,</hi> in an occa≈øion, when by ≈øaving the la≈øt off-≈øpring of the mo≈øt Illu≈øtrious Race of His Kingdom, this ≈øingle act of Clemency would have infinitely more turned to His Honour, than Severity.

Some People were of opinion, that this Prelate, ≈øince he could not prevail with his Maje≈øty to go along with him, was re≈øolved ≈øo to manage Affairs that no body ≈øhould talk with him in his Ab≈øence, the Queen her≈øelf not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.

As ≈øoon as her Maje≈øty arrived, the Duke received her, and waited on her to her Apartment, thinking there was a Coach left for the Cardinal; but it ≈øeems his Orders were ill executed, and indeed there were but Coaches ju≈øt enough for the Queen's Retinue. In the mean time the Cardinal pa≈ø≈øed the River, and finding ne'er a Coach there to receive him, walk'd a foot towards the Duke's Hou≈øe, and was got half the way thither, when the Duke, after he paid his fir≈øt Devoirs to the Queen at his own Hou≈øe, ran to meet him. He made him a thou≈øand Excu≈øes, a≈ø≈øuring him he had given Orders for a Coach to be left for him at the River-≈øide, but that his Commands had not been ob≈øerved. The Cardinal pretended to be well ≈øatisfied with this Excu≈øe, but 'tis certain he was inwardly di≈øplea≈øed with the Duke,

                  </note> All the while her Maje≈øty continued at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Duke of <hi>E≈øpernon</hi> ordered his Guards, whom he kept in Quality of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Province, to leave off their Liveries and Mu≈øquets, and laid a≈øide all the Functions and Marks of his Office; but as ≈øoon as the Queen was gone, he thought there lay no Obligation upon him to ≈øhew the Cardinal that re≈øpect which was only due to a Soveraign. Thus going to make this Mini≈øter a Vi≈øit, who was now on the mending hand, he came, accompanied as far as the Gate of his Lodgings by his Guards, with their Coats and Mu≈øquets. The Cardinal's People, who were u≈øed to make others tremble, run to their Arms, while the Duke enter'd, and without taking the lea≈øt notice of the Di≈øorder he ≈øaw, was got to his Anti-Chamber, where he enquired after his Health. The Cardinal ≈øent him Word that he was ≈øtill ≈øo indi≈øpo≈øed, that he begg'd his Excu≈øe if he could not ≈øee him. After this the Duke ≈øtill
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54967:26"/>ob≈øerved this Cu≈øtom; and when the Cardinal parted for <hi>Brouage,</hi> he went to accompany him to his Boat, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Guards, and ≈øeveral of the Nobility of that Province, as it were to ≈øhew him the greater Honour. However, the Cardinal was afterwards made to believe, that the Duke had ≈øome De≈øign upon his Per≈øon, and 'tis credibly reported, that ever ≈øince that time, this Mini≈øter was not thought to be ≈øafe enough at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But if the Duke had de≈øign'd any thing of that nature, he might ea≈øily have accompli≈øh'd it, being much ≈øtronger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better beloved at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> than the Cardinal was; and be≈øides, the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who was the Duke's Son, never quitted this Mini≈øter, during the whole time of his Illne≈øs.</p>
               <p>While the Cardinal was in the height of his Di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he ordered the Commandeur <hi>de la Porte</hi> his Unkle, and the Marqui≈øs <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> his Cou≈øin to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Queen; who gave her a Magnificent Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Richlieu</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had lately built, and had made a very plea≈øant place. He was not fully recovered, when he cau≈øed him≈øelf to be carried to <hi>Blaye,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> where he was intirely re≈øtored to his health.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54967:27"/>the Force of his Arms, and brought the Rebels to due Puni≈øhment, there had been any ≈øo bold and adventurous as to attempt ≈øuch an Enterprize; But that ≈øince ≈øome di≈øaffected Per≈øons ≈øtill ≈øought new occa≈øions to embroil the Nation, he wou'd immediately come to <hi>Paris</hi> to ≈øet all things in order. He al≈øo Congratulated her good Fortune, that ≈øhe had ≈øo happily e≈øcaped the Snare that was laid for her; and added, That if ≈øhe had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he wou'd have gone in Per≈øon with an Army of Fifty thou≈øand Men into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to ≈øet her at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again.</p>
               <p>This Lady had lived, till the above-mention'd Affair came to be di≈øcover'd, in an H√¥tel which joyned to <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi>-Hou≈øe, and which the Queen-Mother had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed upon the Cardinal when he was in her Favour, upon condition that ≈øhe might take it into her own hands again whenever ≈øhe pleas'd, paying down the Sum of Thirty thou≈øand Livres. When ≈øhe came to fall out with this Prelate, ≈øhe demanded to have this H√¥tel ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to her; and having ≈øent for the Contract, ≈øhe found, that in≈øtead of ≈øo many <hi>Livres,</hi> it was <hi>Crowns;</hi> and that in≈øtead of <hi>whenever ≈øhe plea≈øed,</hi> it was, <hi>when the King commanded it.</hi> The Queen prote≈øted, That ≈øhe never meant to make any ≈øuch Articles as the≈øe, and charged the Cardinal with Forgery. She Addre≈ø≈øed her ≈øelf to the King, to oblige him to deliver it up; but His Maje≈øty, the more to Mortifie her, wou'd have the Cardinal ≈øtill keep in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. This ill u≈øage vexed this Prince≈øs extreamly: but ≈øhe had farther occa≈øion to complain, when being out of <hi>France</hi> ≈øhe was inform'd, that <hi>Combalet</hi> lived there, and daily receiv'd Vi≈øits from Per≈øons of the Fir≈øt Quality, who made their Court to her Unkle by going to ≈øee her. Be≈øides this, ≈øhe made ≈øeveral new alterations in the Hou≈øe for her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; and, for this purpo≈øe, without any more adoe, cau≈øed part of the Wall belonging to the Palace of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi> to be beaten down. 'Tis believ'd that it was partly occa≈øion'd by this, that the Queen fell upon the de≈øign, to have <hi>Combalet</hi> ≈øtollen away, although there is no que≈øtion, but that ≈øhe made the≈øe Alterations by her Unkle's Orders, not being naturally of ≈øo haughty a humour, as to di≈øoblige the Queen-Mother in ≈øo high
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54967:27"/>a point as this was, of her own head. However, when this De≈øign was di≈øcover'd, ≈øhe thought her ≈øelf no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ≈øafe in this Hou≈øe, and went to live at her Unkle's Palace, where ≈øhe ≈øeldom ≈øtirr'd out of doors.</p>

               <p>The Baron <hi>de Charnace,</hi> Amba≈ø≈øadour to the <hi>States-General,</hi> offer'd them the Troops above-mention'd, and the Continuation of a Million of Livres for a year.

                  <hi>Chateau-Thierry;</hi> where, on the very Night of his arrival he waited upon the King and Queen. Next day the Cardinal-Duke made him a Vi≈øit, and gave him abundance of civil words, but very ≈ømall hopes as to the Affairs of the Duke his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It was to no purpo≈øe that the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> repre≈øented to him, That this Prince had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to keep the Treaty of <hi>Liverdun,</hi> and as little did it ≈øignifie to excu≈øe the Infractions they reproached him with. The Mini≈øter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. an≈øwer'd, <q>That they were heartily ≈øorry to find that the Effects did not agree with his Promi≈øes, and that the King being now upon a Journey, was not in a condition to hear any Talk of Bu≈øine≈øs: That in a few days His Maje≈øty wou'd arrive at <hi>Bar,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might inform him nearer at hand, which of the two ways, either that of Gentlene≈øs, or that of Force he wou'd have employ'd again≈øt him, that they might be ≈øecure of him for the future.</q> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> prote≈øted, that the Duke was ready to ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render all the Places he held in <hi>Al≈øatia</hi> to the King; but this was not ≈øufficient: and, to ≈øatisfie them that he wou'd break his Word no more with them, it was propos'd, That a <hi>French</hi> Garri≈øon ≈øhou'd be left in <hi>Nancy,</hi> the mo≈øt con≈øiderable Place in all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nay, the Cardinal his Brother offer'd to con≈øent to the di≈ø≈øolution of the Marriage between his Si≈øter
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54967:36"/>and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and begg'd pardon for it. But the Cardinal-Duke told him, <q>That this Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not equal the Injury that had been done to the King, and that His Maje≈øty found him≈øelf oblig'd to put the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> out of a condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wor≈øe than his Word for the future; that for this end it was nece≈ø≈øary the King ≈øhou'd have <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> by way of Caution, which the Duke ≈øhould forfeit for ever, that very moment he attempted any thing again≈øt <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> reply'd; That this was all one as to propo≈øe to his Brother to lo≈øe the remainder of his Dominions, becau≈øe ≈øuch ≈øort of Pawns are very rarely Deliver'd: That it wou'd be too mean-≈øpirited a conde≈øcen≈øion in a Prince to ≈øtoop ≈øo low as voluntarily to ≈øtrip him≈øelf of his Territories in the way of Negotiation; that it was too ≈øevere a Mortification to lo≈øe ones Honour and ones Country at the ≈øame time; and that let the War ≈øucceed never ≈øo ill, it was impo≈ø≈øible for him to be a greater Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: That <hi>Lorrain</hi> was the Half-way-Hou≈øe between <hi>France</hi> and the States of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> and that the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> were con≈øequently obliged in point of Intere≈øt, to pre≈øerve an Amity both with one and the other: That this caution which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, wou'd ≈øo highly provoke the Emperour, upon whom the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain</hi> depended, that he wou'd confi≈øcate it, and put it under the Imperial Ban, which might happen at a juncture, when the King of <hi>France</hi> being employ'd el≈øewhere, wou'd not be in a condition to ≈øupport him.</p>
               <p>The≈øe Rea≈øons, however ≈øpecious they were, made no Impre≈ø≈øion upon the Cardinal-Duke, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to ruine the Hou≈øe of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> And ≈øo the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went, in all ha≈øt, the very ≈øame day, to carry this ill News to his Brother, and the King advanced with his Forces as he had given this Prince to under≈øtand.

Whether the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> thought that this was onely a pretence, or that he had ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rea≈øon not to give his A≈ø≈øent to this Propo≈øal; he thanked the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for the great honour he did him; and made An≈øwer, <q>That he ≈øhould be ≈øorry to have the World believe, that he had made the King go into <hi>Lorrain</hi> for his particular intere≈øt, as it wou'd be apt to believe, if he accepted the Honour which they did his Neice: That the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> ought, before all things, to give the King ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and, after that, His Maje≈øty wou'd ≈øee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Marriage wou'd be advantageous for His Service, and take his Mea≈øures accordingly.</q>

               <p>In this juncture, the Cardinal-Duke repre≈øented to the King, <q>That if he did not ≈øuddenly ≈øurprize the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> there wou'd be no likelihood of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing him in a long time: That <hi>Nancy</hi> was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable place, regularly Fortifi'd, and not to be taken by force this Campagne: That it wou'd take up ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight Months to reduce it by a Blockade, and that abundance of things might happen in that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val: That a Peace might be made in <hi>Germany,</hi> and a Truce in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that if it were ≈øo, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> wou'd be in a condition to make a powerful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion: That, to Block up <hi>Nancy,</hi> it wou'd require Twenty thou≈øand Foot, and Three thou≈øand Hor≈øe; be≈øides that there mu≈øt be a ≈ømall Army to attend the King's Per≈øon, which wou'd demand a prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: That, on the other hand, to ≈øuffer tamely an Affront in State-matters, was the ready way to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion a greater: That Money was of no u≈øe to His Maje≈øty, if he did not employ it for his Nece≈ø≈øities; that is to ≈øay, to ≈øupport his Reputation, or to enlarge his Dominions: That a Million of Gold was ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bear the extraordinary Expences of this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe: That he cou'd never expect a fairer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and that the War, which raged in all p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That a Man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be upon his Guard, to protect him≈øelf not onely from open violence, but from the ≈øecret practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of others: That on the other hand, if the Duke was once ruin'd, the Marriage of <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> wou'd break of cour≈øe; and that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had told the Abbot of <hi>Elbene,</hi> That he ≈øhould not be ≈øorry to ≈øee him reduced to ≈øuch a pa≈øs: That <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was too much an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant to his Intere≈øt, and <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> had too little Re≈øolution to ≈øtick to a Woman, by whom he ≈øhould gain no advantage, and who be≈øides wou'd be a charge to him: That by this means <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> wou'd be brought to a nece≈ø≈øity to find out a way to get him≈øelf reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the King, by offering to take another Wife; whereas ≈øo long as the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ≈øub≈øi≈øted, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur</hi> wou'd never think of an Accommodation.

               </p>
               <p>The King reli≈øhing the Cardinal's Rea≈øons for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> advanced as far as <hi>Bar,</hi> where he left the Queen, and the other Ladies of the Court.

               <p>At la≈øt the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> told <hi>Richlieu,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was ≈øo unfortunate, that he cou'd not engage His Maje≈øty to repo≈øe any confidence in him, he was re≈øolv'd to Re≈øign his Dominions to him the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in ca≈øe the King approved of it. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> An≈øwer'd, <q>That he did not believe the King wou'd oppo≈øe this Re≈øignation, if the Duke was fully re≈øolved to put it in Execution; and, that he, for his part, had rea≈øon to wi≈øh it might be ≈øo, his pa≈øt-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct giving them hopes that he wou'd be better affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>France;</hi> but, the Mi≈øchief on't was, that this remedy was uneffectual, becau≈øe as the Duke was of a wavering and fickle temper, he might take a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to rea≈øume his Dominions, which wou'd be an ea≈øie matter for him to effect by recovering <hi>Nancy,</hi> at a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture when the King happened to be employ'd el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> found by this, that it was not po≈ø≈øible to ≈øave <hi>Nancy.</hi> It was ≈øome time ago ≈øince he had demanded a Pa≈øsport of the King to come and go, and fetch his Dome≈øticks and Equipage out of the City: The King had granted it him, and the Duke his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he having con≈øider'd, that the Prince≈øs <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> being the principal occa≈øion of the War, might be in danger, if <hi>Nancy</hi> was taken while he was there; they re≈øolved to contrive her e≈øcape out of the City, and afterwards out of <hi>Lerrain,</hi> to ≈øend her into <hi>Flanders</hi> to her Husband.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> got her di≈øguis'd in Man's Apparel, and carried her in his Coach out of the Town. At la≈øt an old Gentleman, and two Soldiers dre≈øt up like Lacqueys, conducted her through ≈øeveral Quarters of the Royal Army, without meeting any ≈øtop by the

They ≈øent to this Prince≈øs all ≈øhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> went to meet her as far as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King being at <hi>S. Nicholas,</hi> where he arrived tho 24th of that Month, received Advice, That the Prince≈øs <hi>Margaret</hi> had made her e≈øcape into <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the manner as I have already related it. This News ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly di≈øplea≈øed him as well as the Cardinal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the con≈øequences which might attend the flight of this Prince≈øs, or becau≈øe it vexed them to be Tricked by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in who≈øe Integrity they had repo≈øed a Confidence. 'Tis true, S. <hi>Chamond</hi> had been ordered to examine all the Cardinal's Coaches, but that, wherein the Prince≈øs was, pa≈ø≈øed by one Morning before he was up, and was not at all Examin'd. The King being angry at this Trick that was play'd him, ≈øent Word to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> That ≈øince the Negotiation was broke, he de≈øign'd that the Pa≈øsports he had given him ≈øhou'd be Revoked; and that if he tarried in the City, he mu≈øt expect to be made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner of War. However, the King gave him leave to come to <hi>Neufville;</hi> where the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed to him, That he had contributed to his Si≈øter's E≈øcape; but then he a≈ø≈øured him, That ≈øhe was ≈øtill in the Dominions of the Duke his Brother, and that he might di≈øpo≈øe of her Per≈øon.</p>
               <p>Next day they learnt the quite contrary News, and <hi>Nancy</hi> being Inve≈øted on all ≈øides, they began to Work on the Lines of Circumvallation and Contravallation, becau≈øe they were afraid the Siege wou'd la≈øt a long while, and that the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> and <hi>Aldringuen</hi> wou'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54967:38"/>come to releve the place. But the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was of a light and changeable di≈øpo≈øition, had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the Defence of this City, though the pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or lo≈øs of his Dominions ab≈øolutely depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>Thus, after ≈øome Propo≈øals, to no purpo≈øe, the Cardinal his Brother was obliged to Sign a Treaty on the 6th of <hi>September,</hi> by which he promis'd to deliver <hi>Nancy</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three days into the King's hands, to keep ≈øuch a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon there as he ≈øhou'd think fitting, till ≈øuch time as his own good Behaviour, or the Peace of <hi>Germany</hi> ≈øhould convince His Maje≈øty, that he had nothing to apprehend on that ≈øide. He con≈øented be≈øides, That the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age age of the Prince≈øs <hi>Margaret</hi> ≈øhould be declared null, in all the Forms, and that within Fifteen days ≈øhe ≈øhould be put into His Maje≈øty's hands, who had agreed, that ≈øhe ≈øhou'd tarry at <hi>Nancy,</hi> that he might inform him≈øelf upon the place, of all the Circum≈øtances of her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> de≈øir'd permi≈ø≈øion of the King, to goe and find out the Duke his Brother, that he might Ratifie this Treaty. In the mean time the King took <hi>Charmes,</hi> and the Duke retired to <hi>Remire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> from which place he ≈øent his Brother back again to the King, to endeavour to gain as much time as he cou'd. But the Succours he expected not coming, he had a mind to go and Treat in Per≈øon with the King, an Indi≈øcretion ≈øcarce to be parallel'd in Hi≈øtory. To this end having demanded a Pa≈øsport, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately granted him, he arrived at <hi>Charmes</hi> on the 18th of <hi>September</hi> with 800 Hor≈øe. There he Negotiated for the ≈øpace of Three days with the Cardinals of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> and <hi>Bich,</hi> who manag'd him ≈øo dexterou≈øly, that on the Third he Ratifi'd the Treaty in the form they de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Thus although he Writ to have the Gates open'd to the King's People, yet ≈øince the Mark was not in the Letter, the Governour refus'd to obey. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal who was more cunning than he, had, at fir≈øt, ≈øome Su≈øpicion of him, that he de≈øign'd to withdraw; and, under a pretence of Treating him like a Great Prince, the King ≈øet his own Guards upon the Hou≈øe where he Lodg'd.</p>
               <p>The Duke was ≈øen≈øible of it; and they made no difficulty to tell him the Rea≈øon of it; ≈øo that having no hopes to e≈øcape, he Writ to <hi>Nancy,</hi> and ≈øent the Mark in the Letter. The King's Garri≈øon enter'd the Town on the 24th of <hi>September,</hi> ≈øeized all the con≈øiderable Po≈øts, built a ≈øort of a Fort upon the Ba≈øtions of the old City, and di≈øarm'd the Inhabitants, who were too well-affected to the Duke. It was of the highe≈øt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the King to have <hi>Nancy</hi> in his hands, as to the Affairs of <hi>Germany;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by this Surrendry to comply for the future with whatever <hi>France</hi> Propo≈øed.</p>
               <p>While the Cardinal-Duke ≈øtay'd at <hi>Charmes,</hi> he was de≈øirous to ≈øee, whether the offer which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had made him about Marrying his Neice, was ≈øincere. For this end he ≈øhow'd extraordinary Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>Chamvallon,</hi> who had appear'd very zealous to have the Match concluded, that ≈øo he might engage him to rea≈ø≈øume this Negotiation. As the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> when he threw up his Cardinal's-Cap, wou'd be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe oblig'd to re≈øign all the Eccle≈øia≈øtical Benefices he po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd; ≈øo it was convenient on the other ≈øide, that he ≈øhould have an E≈øtate ≈øufficient to ≈øupport his Dignity.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54967:39"/>The Cardinal-Duke promis'd to give his Neice a va≈øt Portion, and to make her his Heir of the greate≈øt part of his Wealth; and therefore he expected that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ≈øhou'd ≈øettle upon his Brother Land, to the value of a Hundred thou≈øand Crowns a year, that ≈øo he might be enabled to bear the Title of Duke, which, together with the above-mention'd Revenue, ≈øhou'd de≈øcend to the I≈ø≈øue of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> even though the Duke ≈øhou'd happen to have Children. If the Duke wou'd con≈øent to this, the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> oblig'd him≈øelf to employ all his Intere≈øt with the King, to get the Dutchy of <hi>Bar</hi> ≈øurrendred to him, for which he ≈øhou'd do homage, not in the Name of his Wife, as it had been pretended, but as Rightful Heir; however, with this provi≈øo, that he ≈øhou'd immediately after ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up this Dutchy to his Brother; that he ≈øhou'd a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign him the Hundred thou≈øand Crowns upon its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancies; and that in ca≈øe it was not enough to make up that Sum, he ≈øhou'd annex ≈øome Neighbouring-Lands: as on the other hand, if it was more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the over-plus ≈øhou'd belong to him. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal wou'd not ≈øpeak to the King about this Affair him≈øelf, but he got it to be propo≈øed by the other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of State, and its probable it had ≈øucceeded, if the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> cou'd have been prevail'd upon to cut off ≈øo con≈øiderable a part of his Dominions, as that was, which they demanded of him.

But upon the≈øe Matters great difficulties aro≈øe on both ≈øides.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had an inexpre≈ø≈øible aver≈øion to <hi>France,</hi> and to the Cardinal, which was the rea≈øon why they treated him ≈øo ≈øeverely; and was not of a temper to embrace any Party, merely upon the account of its being the ≈øafe≈øt. He had likewi≈øe great Di≈øputes about the Confines of his Country with <hi>France,</hi> which did her ≈øelf Ju≈øtice by force of Arms. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had been Promis'd long before to a Prince≈øs of his own Family, and Si≈øter to the Durche≈øs; who, if the other March went forward, mu≈øt be ≈øent to a Mona≈øtery.

               <p>However, this Alliance ≈øeemed ≈øo advantageous to the Cardinal, that 'twas generally believ'd he de≈øir'd it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he an≈øwer'd the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> coldly enough, That his Neice was ob≈øtinately re≈øolv'd to embrace a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life; and that it was not po≈ø≈øible for him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Inclinations. But this was only an Artifice to ≈øecure him≈øelf the more of the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom he looked upon not to be ≈øo cordial in this Affair as he de≈øired, to endeavour, if he cou'd obtain of them, more Advantageous Conditions; but, above all, to ≈øee whether the Hou≈øe of <hi>Lorrain</hi> wou'd yield to depo≈øite their be≈øt Places in the King's hands. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> perceiving <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s de≈øign, re≈øolved to u≈øe the ≈øame Policy, and ≈øeem'd to be indifferent on his ≈øide, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go to <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to know his final Re≈øolution there; though at the ≈øame time he did not di≈øcontinue to ≈øollicit this Affair privately at Court.

As he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, the Cardinal-Duke ≈øent him word, That in a Months time he ≈øhou'd receive a Po≈øitive An≈øwer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Madam <hi>de Combalet</hi> re≈øolved to Marry the ≈øecond time or no. All the World was ≈øen≈øible, that if her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle had thought it expedient for her to Marry again, and e≈øpecially one that was a Prince, ≈øhe wou'd never have wanted much entreaty; but the Rea≈øons above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd ≈øtood in the way, and hindred this Marriage from being concluded ≈øo ha≈øtily.

               <p>All this while the Queen-Mother lived in no great amity with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> through the indi≈øcreet management of Father <hi>Chanteloube</hi> and <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> who, in ≈øtead of reconciling them, made the breach wider, and

Thus the Mother and the Son, who were incapable of finding out of them≈øelves what was their true Intere≈øt, became the ≈øport of their Favourites, who engaged them in all their quarrels and caprices.

He told him, <q>That the Queen-Mother had appeared long ago ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the State: That before ≈øhe left <hi>France</hi> the King had offer'd her very rea≈øonable Terms of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, as Places, Governments, and ≈øo forth, by which ≈øhe might ea≈øily perceive, that he had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to u≈øe her with any Rigour: That neverthele≈øs ≈øhe had fled to the declared Enemies of the Crown, which ≈øhe had never done, but out of a Principle of Revenge, and becau≈øe ≈øhe never de≈øign'd to come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øort of Accommodation: That ≈øhe cou'd not be ignorant that her joyning with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> wou'd di≈øplea≈øe the King, and that all good <hi>Frenchmen</hi> mu≈øt blame her for having recour≈øe to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> That ≈øince ≈øhe had broke through all the≈øe con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it was a ≈øure Indication, that ≈øhe had an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred to <hi>France:</hi> That her Actions notoriou≈øly contradicted her words, in which ≈øhe prote≈øted that ≈øhe had no de≈øign again≈øt the State, but that ≈øhe was full of Di≈ø≈øimulation, as vi≈øibly appear'd in the whole Conduct of her Life: That it wou'd be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the King to be Reconciled with her, and call her home; but that on the contrary, ≈øeveral great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences might happen upon it, becau≈øe it wou'd be then a harder matter to per≈øwade <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> to return: That her falling out with him and his Dome≈øticks,

               <p>As for what related to <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> the Cardinal ob≈øerv'd, <q>That this Prince's Ab≈øence was at pre≈øent Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to His Maje≈øty; but that the longer he tarried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom he daily contracted a greater Friend≈øhip, the more it was to be feared, that he wou'd, one day, de≈øtroy in a moment, what had been doing for ≈øeveral years, with no little difficulty, for the welfare of the State: That however the≈øe ills were at a di≈øtance, whereas the Mi≈øchief which he might occa≈øion, if he lived in <hi>France,</hi> and was ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to it, as he certainly was, wou'd be felt pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That if <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> came back into <hi>France,</hi> upon tho≈øe Conditions the King had offer'd him, which, as they were honourable to him≈øelf, ≈øo they were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to <hi>France,</hi> his return wou'd be advantageous to the Kingdom; but that there was a great deal to fear, and but little to hope, if he came back upon tho≈øe Terms, which <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had in≈øi≈øted upon the la≈øt Summer, <hi>viz.</hi> the Government of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and <hi>Macon,</hi> to be the Re≈øidence of <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> and his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhold; becau≈øe that then this Prince wou'd be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> an entrance at any time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom, who wou'd be glad of ≈øuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; That, if matters were ≈øo, they mu≈øt lay a≈øide all thoughts of attacking any of their Neighbours, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enlarge the Kingdom, or to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of the Crown, becau≈øe it was always to be fear'd,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54967:45"/>that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wou'd make ≈øome Irruption on that ≈øide; and, that though they did not break in upon them, yet they wou'd cau≈øe ≈øo many alarms there, that their hands wou'd be effectually tied up, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any ju≈øt pretence to complain of them; That the di≈øaffected wou'd take fre≈øh courage, and fall upon new de≈øigns.</q> In fine, the Cardinal concluded, that it wou'd be better to leave <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> where he was, than to receive him upon tho≈øe conditions which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>However, he at la≈øt propo≈øed, Whether one might not, in Ju≈øtice and Equity, nay, with honour and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the State, Promi≈øe <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> that <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> and he ≈øhould re≈øide at <hi>Macon,</hi> in order to draw him into <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards ≈øend this latter to Pri≈øon, in ≈øtead of keeping their word with him. As for the equity of the thing, the Cardinal was of opinion it cou'd never be que≈øtion'd, ≈øince <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had been engag'd in ≈øuch Mi≈øchievous De≈øigns again≈øt the State; but then he ≈øaid, His Maje≈øty's Honour wou'd receive an irreparable lo≈øs, if he broke his Word upon this occa≈øion.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54967:46"/>the ri≈øque of lo≈øing all for the future: That at pre≈øent the King de≈øir'd <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> to break off his Marriage with the Prince≈øs <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Marry the Prince≈øs of <hi>Mantua;</hi> yet if this Prince were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither one nor the other cou'd be done, ≈øince the World wou'd ≈øay with rea≈øon, That he was not free: That thus his Marriage with the former wou'd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by it, in ≈øtead of being di≈ø≈øolved: That for the future, tho≈øe that ≈øerved His Maje≈øty cou'd never hope to reconcile them≈øelves to <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> from which no manner of good cou'd arrive to the Kingdom: That His Maje≈øty, to the great Misfortune of <hi>France,</hi> having been Married Eighteen years without any Children, tho≈øe Per≈øons that believed he would never have any I≈ø≈øue, would publickly exclaim, That the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had a mind to de≈øtroy the Pre≈øumptive Heir of the Crown, which might occa≈øion ≈øeveral vexatious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</q> The Cardinal concluded to leave the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> where he was, if he would not return upon the Conditions the King had lately offered him, which were, to give him a con≈øiderable ≈øum of Money to pay his Debts, to re-e≈øtabli≈øh him in all his Appanages and Good, to give great Gratifications to <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow the Government of <hi>Auvergne</hi> upon him, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to re≈øide there with his Guards. If <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed to come back upon the≈øe Conditions, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thought it would be the be≈øt way to let him tarry in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ≈øince any other means of bringing him home were neither honourable nor advantageous.</p>
               <p>The≈øe Conditions having been propo≈øed to the Queen-Mother, and to <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> they equally rejected them: The Queen-Mother could never con≈øent to ≈øee her ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants treated after a wor≈øe manner than tho≈øe of her Son; and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> imagined that they would grant him more, if he refu≈øed the≈øe fir≈øt offers. But the event ≈øhewed, that both of them were mi≈øtaken, and that they had better have adju≈øted matters in time, than ≈øtand out again≈øt a Party which was infinitely ≈øtronger than their own. And the Cardinal, by this means, arrived to the de≈øign he propo≈øed to him≈øelf, which was, to keep the Queen-Mother and <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> but e≈øpecially the former, out of <hi>France,</hi> as long as he was able.</p>

His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Cardinal, endeavour'd to excu≈øe him, by ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He had done all that lay in his Power to get the Prince≈øs <hi>Margaret</hi> out of the hands of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> but that this Prince would not part with her. He de≈øired the Cardinal-Duke to Intercede for him with the King, that his Citation might be Su≈øpended; and declared, That if they proceeded farther, his Brother would not make his Appearance, as being prejudicial to the Rights of a Soveraign Prince. <hi>Richlieu</hi> maintained, That as he was a Va≈ø≈øal of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> for the Dukedom of <hi>Bar,</hi> he was obliged to come in Per≈øon thither, which, if he neglected to doe, or was declared to be an Accomplice in the Rape, they ≈øhould be forced to proceed again≈øt him, by the ways of Fact.

               <p>Thus they Mortified the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and now began to give New Vexations to the Queen-Mother, by ≈øtopping, and narrowly examining upon the Frontiers all the Carriages that came to her from <hi>France</hi> for her own u≈øe, and that of her Servants, though a Pa≈øsport was allowed her.

               <p>Not long after, the Attorney-General, following the In≈øtructions of the Court, pre≈øented a Reque≈øt to the Parliament, to declare, That the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had been Stollen out of <hi>France</hi> by the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and con≈øequently, that his Marriage was null and void. The Parliament demanded time to inform and deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Affair of ≈øo great a Con≈øequence, but a very ≈øhort ≈øpace was allowed them; and the King came thither in Per≈øon on the 18th of <hi>January</hi> with the Cardinal, to get a Declaration confirmed, by which he re≈øtored the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to his E≈øtate and Honour, provided, that in Three Months he acknowledged his Fault, and came to Re≈øide in <hi>France.</hi> He extended the ≈øame Favours to all his Dome≈øticks, except <hi>Coigneux, Mon≈øigot, Vieville,</hi> and ≈øome others. The King al≈øo declar'd, that he could not approve of the Marriage of <hi>Men≈øieur</hi> for the Rea≈øons ≈øpecified in His Declaration; and ordered the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Judge of the Informations which had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken again≈øt the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to Ju≈øtifie, that he had cau≈øed <hi>Mon≈øiuer</hi> to be ≈øtollen, and con≈øequently to ≈øhow that his Marriage was null.</p>

               <p>The Parliament was not a little perplexed about <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur</hi>'s Marriage, by rea≈øon of the ill Con≈øequences which the Judgment they gave might draw after it; ≈øince it concern'd the Heirs of a Prince who might one day ≈øit upon the Throne. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was generally blamed for giving his Con≈øent to this Match, which, as it di≈øplea≈øed the Court, ≈øo it had plunged him in very mortifying Circum≈øtances. Otherwi≈øe this Marriage was neither too unequal, nor was it di≈øadvantageous to the State; and indeed, nothing could be found fault in it, but that it was done without the King's Approbation, who might at la≈øt approve of it, after he had te≈øtified his Di≈ølike of it, as in the Up≈øhot he was obliged to do. To revenge him≈øelf for this Affront, he demanded <hi>Zore</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which is a Place between <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Thionville,</hi> to Fortifie it. The Duke immediately granted it, becau≈øe he dur≈øt not do otherwi≈øe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the King promi≈øed to ≈øurrender it to him, not by Letters Patent, but by a private Letter of the Privy Seal, to denote the King's Superiority: He likewi≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Duke, the original Contract of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and all the Papers he had in his hands relating to that Affair. He de≈øired to know who were the Witne≈ø≈øes that had a≈ø≈øi≈øted at the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the E≈øpou≈øals, and to have the Prie≈øt, who had officiated, deliver'd up to him. On the other hand, to make the Duke ≈øen≈øible that in ca≈øe he would ≈øubmit him≈øelf he might expect a gentler Treatment, Orders were ≈øent to the Parliament of <hi>Metz</hi> to deferr the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition which they had been commanded to i≈ø≈øue out to the Inhabitants of the Lands depending upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhopricks of <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> not to own the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> any longer for their Prince; and they ≈øuffer'd him to gather his Revenues in the Dukedom of <hi>Bar,</hi> without pre≈ø≈øing him to come and do Homage for it.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54967:48"/>therefore, that he might be able to declare openly again≈øt her, without Danger of being deprived of the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Dominions, he made on the 19th of <hi>January</hi> a Donation of his Seats to his Brother <hi>Nicholas Francis,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> under a pretence that the Per≈øon of this latter was more agreeable to the King than his own. However, the World was ≈øen≈øible that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was only a Pretence, becau≈øe he performed ≈øeveral Acts of a Sovereign Prince after he had made it.

               <p>The new Duke di≈øpatched <hi>Contri≈ø≈øon</hi> immediately to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint the King and Cardinal with what had pa≈ø≈øed between his Brother and him, and to promi≈øe that he wou'd ob≈øerve the Treaty of <hi>Charmes.</hi> As for his Brother, he a≈ø≈øur'd them that he did not know whither he was gone: but this did not hinder the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from carrying on the Proce≈øs they had begun again≈øt him.

For the fir≈øt, the Duke's Dominions, in the Opinion of this Mini≈øter, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>France,</hi> and could not be re≈øtored to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> but upon the ≈øame Conditions by which his Brother held them: And as for the ≈øecond, the Duke was not excu≈øed from the Guilt of it by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting him≈øelf. Be≈øides this, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was his Accomplice in the Matter, for he, as Bi≈øhop of <hi>Thoul,</hi> had granted a Di≈øpen≈øation not publi≈øhing the Banns, as otherwi≈øe they ought to have done for the Marriage of <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> and the Prince≈øs <hi>Margaret,</hi> and had authorized a Monk to ≈øay Ma≈øs upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, to the prejudice of the Curate, that this Affair might be kept the more ≈øecret.</q> The Cardinal Duke reproached him of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with having abu≈øed the King's Pa≈ø≈øport to further his Si≈øter's E≈øcape out of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and to ≈øend her to <hi>Bru≈ø≈øels.</hi>

               <p>Thus the Princes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> found them≈øelves engaged in very great Perplexities, and were at a Lo≈øs how to appea≈øe <hi>France,</hi> or how to defend them≈øelves again≈øt her. Nothing, in all appearance, but the Match propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to the Cardinal's Neice, could accommodate the≈øe Differences: but ≈øeveral great Difficulties aro≈øe in that Affair, as I have already ob≈øerved. On the other hand, it was to be feared, that if the Cardinal-Duke ≈øu≈øpected that they had asked his Neice in Marriage only to amu≈øe him, he would revenge the Affront in a cruel manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contri≈ø≈øon</hi> was ≈øent back to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with Orders to tell him, that it was in his power to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Brother's Steps or not; but that if he de≈øired to live in peace, he mu≈øt take different mea≈øures. He was demanded to explain him≈øelf upon this Head, and that he would di≈øcover by his manner of acting what were his true Sentiments. But above all, it was de≈øired of him that he wou'd di≈øapprove the Marriage of his Si≈øter, and deliver the Original Papers of the Contract, and the Di≈øpen≈øation for the Banns.

               <p>As the King neither liked nor di≈øliked the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Surrendry of his Dominions to his Brother, the latter took upon him the Title of <hi>Duke,</hi> and put him≈øelf in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the State belonging to his Family, with the u≈øual Solemnities, that ≈øo he might convince the World there was no Collu≈øion in this Matter between his Brother and him.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54967:49"/>the ea≈øier to get the Marriage annull'd: That they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knew who were the Witne≈ø≈øes, and that as for them and the Monk, who had di≈øappeared, the King would let them ≈øee, to their Co≈øt, that he had long Hands.</q> At la≈øt he concluded, That whereas he had been formerly a Friend to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> he wou'd be his greate≈øt Enemy if he continued to follow the Maxims of his Brother.</p>
               <p>As for what concerned the Taking of <hi>Saverne,</hi> the King, according to the Cardinal, was not obliged to make any Excu≈øes for what had been done upon very ju≈øt Grounds: And he added, <q>That if the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had defended it, they wou'd have taken it away from him by force: That they wou'd con≈øider what was to be done to the Governours of tho≈øe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which his Maje≈øty held in tru≈øt, who had hinder'd the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> from rai≈øing his Duties: That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of allowing farther time for him to do Homage for the Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> he mu≈øt expect every moment to ≈øee it declared lap≈øed to the King, by the Duke's Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and incorporated to the Crown, and that the Principal might well follow the Acce≈ø≈øary.</q> His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that they might ju≈øtly enough ≈øeize upon all <hi>Lorrain</hi> by vertue of a Decree of Parliament which wou'd be inflicted upon the Duke by way of Puni≈øhment for his ≈øtealing away <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> and for the Charges of War.</p>
               <p>After this manner it was that the Cardinal-Duke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oblige tho≈øe, that were weaker than him≈øelf, to ≈øubmit to his imperious Will, under a Pretence of doing Ju≈øtice to the King's Reputation.

               <p>While this pa≈ø≈øed in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Cardinal made great Promi≈øes to <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> and <hi>Puilaurens</hi> to draw them into <hi>France,</hi> for fear lea≈øt <hi>Ga≈øton</hi> ≈øhould reconcile him≈øelf to the Queen-Mother.

The Queen-Mother, who ≈øtill fell out more and more with the D. of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and found there was no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of adju≈øting Differences with him, ≈øo long as <hi>Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurens</hi> continued near his Per≈øon, was at the ≈øame time inclined to make her Peace with the King, whatever it co≈øt her; and ≈øhe was ≈øo much the more di≈øpo≈øed to u≈øe this Conduct, becau≈øe ≈øhe perceived that the <hi>Marqui≈øs d' Aytone,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ≈øhew'd a greater Re≈øpect to <hi>Ga≈øton</hi> than her ≈øelf. She cau≈øed F. <hi>Chanteloube</hi> to write to <hi>Bouthillier,</hi> that ≈øhe was re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to come and throw her ≈øelf upon his Maje≈øty's Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro≈øity, and to be reconciled to the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> if the King commanded her to do it. <hi>Bouthillier</hi> carried this Letter to the King, ≈øeal'd as it was, and at the ≈øame time cau≈øed the Main that brought it, and came without a Pa≈ø≈øport, to be ≈øecured at his own Hou≈øe.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54967:53"/>the Man that by his defamatory Libels had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to take away his Reputation, as the Abbot of St. <hi>Germain</hi> had notoriou≈øly done; and la≈øtly, the Man that by attacking the Life of His Maje≈øty's mo≈øt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, gave him all the ju≈øt rea≈øon in the World to be apprehen≈øive of his own.</q>

               <p>Before <hi>de Laleu</hi> return'd to <hi>Bru≈ø≈øels,</hi> he received fre≈øh Letters for the King and Cardinal, in which the Queen-Mother confirm'd the ≈øame things, in terms ≈øtill more humble and conde≈øcending, particularly in regard to the Cardinal. She likewi≈øe demanded a Pa≈ø≈øport for Father <hi>Suffren,</hi> her Confe≈ø≈øor, whom ≈øhe de≈øired to ≈øend to Court. But An≈øwer was made, that they wou'd hearken to no one, unle≈øs he brought them word from the Queen, that ≈øhe was ready to deliver into his Maje≈øty's hands the three Per≈øons he demanded of her. <hi>De Laleu</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> with this ≈øad Me≈ø≈øage, which made the Queen lo≈øe all hopes of ever ≈øeeing the King her Son again.</p>
               <p>While the≈øe Negotiations were managed by the Queen-Mother, <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> con≈øulted the Univer≈øity of <hi>Louvain</hi> about his Marriage, which they judged to be valid, and he got it to be ≈øolemnly confirmed by the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Malines,</hi> in the pre≈øence of ≈øeven Witne≈ø≈øes. The Queen-Mother was de≈øired to be pre≈øent at this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54967:53"/>Ceremony, but refu≈øed it, whether ≈øhe had re≈øolved to concern her ≈øelf no more with the Affairs of <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> as ≈øhe had told him, or was not willing to di≈øoblige the King, at a time when ≈øhe endeavour'd to appea≈øe him. However, when ≈øhe received the abovementioned News, ≈øhe was ≈øo far from complying with tho≈øe di≈øhonourable Submi≈ø≈øions they expected from her, that ≈øhe be≈øtowed upon the Abbot of St. <hi>Germain</hi> the Place of her chief Almoner, which happen'd then to be vacant. At the ≈øame time the Court employ'd the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to engage the Pope to declare the Marriage of <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> null, by repre≈øenting to him all the Rea≈øons they could think of.

It was likewi≈øe propo≈øed, That he ≈øhould con≈øent that tho≈øe Judges whom the Pope ≈øhould nominate out of the Bi≈øhops of <hi>France,</hi> ≈øhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54967:55"/>the Validity of his Marriage; but he wou'd give his Con≈øent neither to the one nor the other. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Mon≈øieur had made with the Marqui≈øs <hi>d' Aytone</hi> was not perhaps kept ≈øo ≈øecret but they had ≈øome Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it in <hi>France</hi> before they happen'd to light upon the abovementioned Ratification, and the Abbot of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bene</hi> reproached Mon≈øieur with it. It was al≈øo known that he had written to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he wou'd never agree that the <hi>French</hi> Eccle≈øia≈øticks ≈øhould judge of this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and that he had complain'd that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> de≈øign'd to call in que≈øtion his Right of Succe≈ø≈øion to the Crown, and for that end had made an Alliance with ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Heretick Princes, at the time when <hi>Ga≈øton</hi> had married a Prince≈øs of a mo≈øt Catholick Family.</p>
               <p>The Abbot of <hi>Elbene,</hi> at his Return to <hi>Paris,</hi> gave an Account of his Negotiation, and told them he was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of opinion, that if they let alone the bu≈øine≈øs of the Prince≈øs <hi>Margaret,</hi> Mon≈øieur would readily accept the Conditions that were offer'd him. But whether the King was po≈ø≈øe≈øt with is ancient Jealou≈øie again≈øt his Brother, or whether the Cardinal was not willing that this Prince ≈øhould have a Lady that was obliged to the Queen-Mother for her Marriage, the Court ob≈øtinately per≈øi≈øted to make him declare it null, under a Pretence that the King had not con≈øented to it.<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>41.</note> A Council was held ju≈øt after the Abbot of <hi>Elbene</hi>'s Return, wherein the Cardinal was pleas'd to ≈øay, <q>That there were but two ways to pre≈øerve the King from the ill De≈øigns of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur; the fir≈øt of which wholly depended upon the Ble≈ø≈øing of Heaven, and the other upon his Maje≈øty's Prudence. The fir≈øt was, if the King had a Son who might take away all hopes from the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> of ever finding the Throne vacant for him≈øelf. The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, according to the Cardinal's Notion of Things, was, a firm A≈ø≈øociation between tho≈øe of who≈øe Fidelity his Maje≈øty was a≈ø≈øured; which might make Mon≈øieur's Adherents ≈øen≈øible, that if they ha≈øten'd that Prince's Succe≈ø≈øion by any indirect means, they wou'd find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons enough ready to cha≈øti≈øe their Wickedne≈øs, and that even if the Throne happen'd to be vacant natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, he ≈øhou'd not take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it without ≈øome Di≈øpute. The Rea≈øon of this was, that if Mon≈øieur
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54967:55"/>believed that after the King's Decea≈øe his Succe≈ø≈øion might be vigorou≈øly conte≈øted, he would never de≈øire his Brother's Death. This Expedient, in the Cardinal's Opinion, was the only means to ≈øecure the King, and to pre≈øerve the State from tho≈øe Dangers into which the De≈øigns of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might throw it, as well as the Cabals of the di≈øaffected <hi>French;</hi> becau≈øe, whenever the King happen'd to die, neither one nor the other could then con≈øtrain Mon≈øieur to act as they plea≈øed; their Power being counterbalanc'd by that of the contrary Party; and that thus his Maje≈øty's Servants, being ≈øupported by the undoubted Right of Mon≈øieur, might be in a condition to defend him again≈øt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and wou'd find their Security in endeavouring the Peace and Welfare of the Kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hi≈øtory no where informs us what Reflections were made upon this ≈øtrange Advice, but 'tis certain it fairly tended to give the Cardinal power to chu≈øe whom of the Princes of the Blood he ≈øhould pitch upon, to ≈øucceed to the Crown. This Mini≈øter who reproached Mon≈øieur with having violated the fundamental Laws of the State, would have per≈øwaded his Maje≈øty, again≈øt all manner of Ju≈øtice, and all received Precedents, to inve≈øt him with an Authority, to which the whole Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple has no right to pretend, in an hereditary Monarchy. Some time after,<note n="*" place="margin">Towards the beginning of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </note> Mon≈øieur reconciled him≈øelf to the Queen his Mother upon the occa≈øion of a Difference that happen'd in his Family, in the heat of which the Queen ≈øent to offer him all her Servants, and to di≈øpo≈øe of them as he ≈øhould think fit. The Duke of <hi>Elbeuf</hi> likewi≈øe made up matters with Mon≈øieur and <hi>Puilaurens;</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was ≈øo uncapable to regulate his Affairs at home, and to make him≈øelf beloved by his Dome≈øticks, that the greate≈øt part of them abandon'd him, without taking their leave of him, and withdrew into <hi>France,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Pa≈ø≈øports were refu≈øed them.</p>
               <p>Thus the Cardinal was in no great pain for any thing the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> might do, becau≈øe in gaining his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, he was a≈ø≈øured to bring him to what Terms he pleas'd. The un≈øhaken and firm Re≈øolution of the Queen-Mother gave him a great deal more trouble; and as he carried Matters to the highe≈øt Extremities, he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54967:56"/>was afraid that this Prince≈øs, provoked to the greate≈øt degree, wou'd cau≈øe him at la≈øt to be a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øinated if ≈øhe ≈øtill continued in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> which are but a few days Journey from <hi>Paris.</hi> Therefore he now thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre≈øh of ≈øending her to <hi>Florence,</hi> whither the Grand Duke offer'd to invite her, if the King thought it convenient.

He was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that though ≈øhe ab≈øolutely rejected it, yet it was good to let her know that the King wou'd not be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed at her going to <hi>Florence. Gondi</hi> undertook this Journey, and pre≈øented to her a Letter from the Grand Duke, wherein he invited her to come and live with him, till ≈øuch time as ≈øhe was reconciled to the King. The Queen received this Complement very kindly, and told him, that the Grand Duke had a greater Con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her than either her own Sons or her Sons-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, of which the former u≈øed her ill, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed her all manner of A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, or el≈øe were weary of giving it any longer. She ≈øeem'd to be very ≈øen≈øible of the Grand Duke's Kindne≈øs, and de≈øired time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider of an An≈øwer till <hi>Gondi</hi> who was going into <hi>Holland</hi> came back again. She gave him to under≈øtand, that ≈øhe was di≈ø≈øatisfied with her Dome≈øticks, that Father <hi>Chanteloube</hi> wanted Integrity, and the Abbot of <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> was a Man of no Judgment; but ≈øhe cou'd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve to turn them away, lea≈øt the World ≈øhould ≈øay that this was an open Acknowledgment that ≈øhe had been ill advi≈øed. The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as ≈øhe told him, did not furni≈øh her with what ≈øhe wanted, but ≈ølowly and with great Difficulty, and ≈øhe wanted ≈øeveral things that were nece≈ø≈øary even for her own Per≈øon. <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> ≈øhe ≈øaid, was the Man that had begun to ruin her, and then had compleated her De≈øtruction; becau≈øe after he had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her again≈øt the Cardinal, by ≈øwearing to her, that he wou'd never abandon her, he had, to regain this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late's Favour, acquainted him with what had pa≈ø≈øed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, before Mon≈øieur parted from <hi>Paris</hi> the fir≈øt time. And afterwards this Man, fearing lea≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhou'd re≈øent this Injury, had done all that lay in his power to ruine her.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:54967:56"/>
               <p>At <hi>Gondi</hi>'s Return from <hi>Holland,</hi> the Queen told him ≈øhe was obliged to the Grand Duke for the great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs he expre≈øs'd towards her; but though ≈øhe did not ab≈øolutely refu≈øe the Treat which he offer'd her, ≈øhe ≈øaid that <hi>Florence</hi> was too far from <hi>Paris,</hi> and that if ≈øhe went thither, her Affairs would go on with too much Slowne≈øs. Upon this Con≈øideration, ≈øhe re≈øerved that place to retire to, when ≈øhe was de≈øtitute of all Hopes to make an Accommodation. She once more intimated to <hi>Gondi,</hi> how little ≈øhe was ≈øatisfied with Father <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teloube,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>St. Germain,</hi> and <hi>Fabbroni,</hi> and own'd, that if the King gave her to under≈øtand that he was plea≈øed ≈øhe ≈øhould di≈ømi≈øs them, ≈øhe would not fail to do it, but that ≈øhe would not after this run the risk of a Refu≈øal, as it had happen'd to her at the beginning of the Year, when they de≈øpi≈øed all her Submi≈ø≈øions. She open'd her ≈øelf very frankly to <hi>Gondi,</hi> becau≈øe he was the Grand Duke's Re≈øident, whom ≈øhe believed to be well-affected to her Intere≈øts, and received his Advice very courteou≈øly. In all the≈øe Conver≈øations, ≈øhe ≈øhed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tears, and ≈øhew'd all imaginable ≈øigns of a great Inclination to be reconciled to her Son, by throwing her ≈øelf wholly upon his Genero≈øity, and demanding nothing of him. Nay, ≈øhe ≈øaid that ≈øhe de≈øired to owe her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Cardinal, and that ≈øhe was very well ≈øatisfied that none but he could ≈øerve her. <hi>Gondi</hi> ≈øaw that ≈øhe was really in a Condition that de≈øerved Commi≈øeration, and her Di≈øcour≈øes were enough to have affected any one but tho≈øe ≈øhe had to deal with.</p>
               <p>At his Arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> he gave the Cardinal and the other Mini≈øters an Account of his Journey, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to repre≈øent to them the hearty Inclinations of the Queen-Mother in ≈øo feeling a manner, that it might touch them with pity.

                  </note> hearken'd to him with a great deal of Indifference, although he ≈øeem'd to be ≈øatisfied with his Negotiation. At la≈øt he told him, that ≈øo long as Father <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> who was convicted of a De≈øign to kill him more than once, continued about the Queen, it was impo≈ø≈øible to repo≈øe any Confidence in her, and that ≈øhe always ≈øaid the ≈øame things.</p>

               <p>The Cardinal came thither from <hi>Ruel,</hi> to vi≈øit the Duke in his Maje≈øty's Pre≈øence.

               <p>The next day the Duke went to <hi>Ruel</hi> to repay the Cardinal the Vi≈øit he had made him, and entertain'd him in private, where 'tis ≈øuppo≈øed he told him all that he knew.

Upon this the Cardinal ≈øent ≈øeveral Divines to him, to cure him of the≈øe trouble≈øome Scruples, for he was ≈øeldom unprovided of dexterous Ca≈øui≈øts that knew how to accommodate his Pa≈ø≈øions to Religion.

               <p>The King, after he had paid to Mon≈øieur the money which he had promis'd him, and expedited the Patents for <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> ≈øent F. <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> and <hi>Bouthillier</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to tell him from him, that he wou'd never approve of his Marriage, though at the ≈øame time he wou'd never force him to marry again.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54967:63"/>had the greate≈øt credit with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> next to <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> was of the ≈øame humour, and had as little Inclination to comply with the Mini≈øter's plea≈øure as the other. The Cardinal fan≈øied he was the Man that po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed <hi>Philaurens</hi> with the≈øe ambitious Thoughts; ≈øo that he re≈øolved to remove him. Upon this he tells <hi>Puilau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> that ≈øince he had contracted ≈øo near an Alliance with him, he was de≈øirous to be united ≈øtill more clo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, but that he cou'd not do it, ≈øo long as he kept Company with <hi>Coudrai Montpen≈øier,</hi> and reckoned him one of his be≈øt Friends. Whether <hi>Philaurens</hi> di≈øtru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Cardinal had ≈øome De≈øign upon him, or el≈øe was re≈øolved to pay no farther regard to this Mini≈øter, in≈øtead of di≈øcarding him, as he was de≈øired, he gave him the next Apartment to his own; which procedure began to incen≈øe the Cardinal, whom all the other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters obeyed at the fir≈øt word, and who cou'd not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt this Oppo≈øition from the Favourite of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whom he had ≈øo far honour'd, as to give him one of his Relations in Marriage.</p>
               <p>Mon≈øieur generally re≈øided at <hi>Blois,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mem. Rec. <hi>T. 8.</hi> P. <hi>199,</hi> &amp;c.</note> it happen'd while he was there, that ≈øeveral <hi>Spaniards</hi> of Quality who travell'd from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Spain</hi> by Land, came to <hi>Blois</hi> to pay their Re≈øpects to him, who received them very courteou≈øly. He frequently mention'd the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that Country with great e≈øteem, as if he intended to ≈øhew his Gratitude for the kind Reception he found among them, and engage them to u≈øe Madam well, who ≈øtill continued in their Territories. This made Don <hi>Cri≈øtoval Benavides,</hi> the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Amba≈ø≈øadour, ≈øay, That although Mon≈øieur left the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> without taking his leave; yet if he went thither a hundred times, and came back as often after the ≈øame manner, he ≈øhould ≈øtill find a hearty Welcome there. This Conduct of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur, and the Di≈øcour≈øes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> gave the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters occa≈øion to ≈øu≈øpect, that he ≈øtill kept ≈øome private Intelligence with them, or at lea≈øt pre≈øerv'd an Affection to that Nation, which might be prejudicial to <hi>France</hi> in the pre≈øent po≈øture of Affairs. On the other hand, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> continually prote≈øted, that if the King cou'd find any way to di≈ø≈øolve his Marriage legally, he wou'd not oppo≈øe it; but that he wou'd never go to tell
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54967:63"/>the Parliament a Sham-≈øtory that he was forced to this Match by the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ≈øince he cou'd neither do it in Con≈øcience nor in Honour. He prai≈øed the Prince≈øs <hi>Margaret</hi> exceedingly, and preferr'd her infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, for her good Qualities, to his fir≈øt Wife. He frequently writ to her, and ≈øent her Money, Cloaths, Liveries for her Servants, two Coaches, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Crowns a Month towards her Expence.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal was of opinion, that this inflexible ≈øteadine≈øs of Mon≈øieur cou'd only proceed from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Puilaurens:</hi> nay, he pretended that this ≈øhew'd him to be ill affected to the King's Per≈øon, and that he de≈øired to behold the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> upon the Throne, that he might become chief Mini≈øter of State; as if the Marriage of Mon≈øieur had any relation to the King's Death. <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was accu≈øed of being familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one <hi>Vieux-Pont,</hi> a Dome≈øtick of Mon≈øieur, who had ≈øpoken ≈øcandalou≈øly of His Maje≈øty. He was likewi≈øe charged with keeping a corre≈øpondence with the Hou≈øe of <hi>Lorrian;</hi> and that the rea≈øon why he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this Marriage was, that this Hou≈øe might ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Prince, in ca≈øe the King happen'd to die. Thus it was interpreted a Crime in the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he wou'd not depend upon the Di≈øcretion of the Mini≈øter for his Succe≈ø≈øion to the Crown; and yet this Mini≈øter mu≈øt be allow'd to take what Securities he pleas'd again≈øt the whole Royal Family, and all the Princes of the Blood.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal, who had always taken great care to keep up that Jealou≈øie which the King ever ≈øince his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy had entertain'd again≈øt his Brother, ea≈øily per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him that all the≈øe Practices of Mon≈øieur only tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dethrone him, and that there was no other way to prevent the De≈øigns of his Dome≈øticks, but to de≈øtroy them. So the King was re≈øolved to apprehend <hi>Puilau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens;</hi> and that he might ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>iving of means to draw him from <hi>Blois</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> To effect this, a Ball was propo≈øed at the <hi>Carnaval,</hi> where Mon≈øieur and <hi>Puilaurens</hi> were invited to dance, as well as the King. They came to <hi>Paris</hi> upon this Occa≈øion, and Mon≈øieur was mightily care≈øs'd on all hands, though they cou'd not prevail with him to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54967:64"/>make the lea≈øt ≈øtep towards the Di≈ø≈øolution of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The 14th of <hi>February</hi> was the Day agreed upon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Puilaurens;</hi> and the Guards at the <hi>Louvre</hi> were order'd to be doubled. This had like to have di≈øcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Plot; for a Footman belonging to the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> having ob≈øerved it, went to his Ma≈øter to bid him have a care of him≈øelf, becau≈øe the Court had ≈øome extraordinary De≈øign on foot. This Prince came to the <hi>Louvre</hi> about Two a clock in the Afternoon, to practi≈øe the Ball before-hand, when he received this Advice; but as fore≈øight was none of his Talents, he neglected it, and went to the King's Chamber, where he ≈øtayed till the Cardinal came there. They had ≈øent to find him out at the Keeper of the Seals, where he dined, and carried the Marqui≈øs <hi>Du Fargis</hi> and <hi>Coudrai Montpen≈øier</hi> with him. When he went away he took <hi>du Fargis</hi> to the <hi>Louvre</hi> along with him, and gave Orders for the other to be apprehended when he offer'd to be gone; which was accordingly executed. Every thing was ready at the <hi>Louvre</hi> to begin the Ball, and none of the Company were wanting but only <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> who made the re≈øt wait above half an hour after the time appointed; which made the King and the Cardinal ≈øu≈øpect that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the De≈øign again≈øt him. At la≈øt he came, and after he had di≈øcour≈øed ≈øome time with the King, the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Cardinal, and other Noblemen of the Court that were pre≈øent, the King took Mon≈øieur by the hand, and led him to his Clo≈øet. This was the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal they agreed upon with the Marqui≈øs <hi>de Gordes,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Charot,</hi> Captains of the Life-Guards, when they were to arre≈øt <hi>Puilaurens</hi> and <hi>du Fargis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They immediately executed the King's Orders, and the≈øe two Dome≈øticks of the Mon≈øieur were taken up without any noi≈øe. The King, as ≈øoon as he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved notice of it, told this Prince what he had done, and at the ≈øame time embraced him, and a≈ø≈øured him that he was perfectly well ≈øatisfied with him. He added that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was an ungrateful Wretch, and that Mon≈øieur cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>d never expect to be well ≈øerv'd by him, after his horrid Ingratitude to the Crown which had been ≈øo kind to him. The Duke ≈øeem'd to be ≈øomewhat concerned
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54967:64"/>at it; but fearing to be ≈øerved after the ≈øame manner him≈øelf, he ≈øaid he would abandon <hi>Puilaurens</hi> for ever, if he had made any unhand≈øome Returns to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty's Favours. The Cardinal came afterwards into the King's Clo≈øet, who≈øe Pre≈øence hearten'd Mon≈øieur a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for he concluded that if there had been any De≈øign to apprehend him, the Cardinal dur≈øt not appear in that place. This Mini≈øter complimented him afre≈øh, and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured him it was his Maje≈øty's Plea≈øure, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ≈øhou'd a≈ø≈øi≈øt at the Council. Mon≈øieur asked him whether the King gave him leave to ≈øtir out of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and go the Palace of <hi>Gui≈øe,</hi> where he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Cardinal told him he might go when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed; ≈øo this Prince, after he had waited upon the Queen at her Apartment, where the King then was, retired. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs he returned to the <hi>Louvre</hi> towards the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although ≈øeveral of his Dome≈øticks had been ≈øeized. <hi>Puilaurens</hi> and <hi>du Fargis</hi> lay at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and were conducted the next day to the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Vincennes;</hi> but <hi>Coudrai Montpen≈øier</hi> was carried to the <hi>Ba≈øtile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this the King publi≈øh'd a circular Letter, which was ≈øent to the Parliaments, and to the Governours of Provinces, to acquaint them, that he had been obliged, for ≈øeveral weighty Rea≈øons, to apprehend ≈øome of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur's Dome≈øticks. It was penn'd in an ob≈øcure ≈øtyle, becau≈øe the Pri≈øoners were not as yet convicted of any crime; but mo≈øt People concluded, that the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter had cau≈øed <hi>Puilaurens</hi> to be confin'd, becau≈øe he cou'd not tru≈øt him any longer, and that he wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps carry his Revenge farther. <hi>Richlieu</hi> ≈øent the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Valette</hi> and <hi>Bouthillier</hi> to Mon≈øieur, to give him fre≈øh A≈ø≈øurances, that he was wholly at his Service, and to tell him, he was heartily ≈øorry that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had forced the King, by committing fre≈øh crimes, to take ≈øo rigorous a cour≈øe with him. It was ob≈øerved that the Cardinal did not go him≈øelf to the Palace of <hi>Gui≈øe,</hi> fearing perhaps lea≈øt a fancy ≈øhould take the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to revenge this ill U≈øage. This Prince told them, that he had promis'd to be a faithful Servant to the King, and a Friend of the Cardinal, and that he wou'd keep his Word: That if he found <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was really guilty, let his fault be what it wou'd, he wou'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54967:65"/>be ≈øo far from making any Interce≈ø≈øion for him, that he wou'd be the fir≈øt man that ≈øhou'd demand Ju≈øtice upon him: That he did not believe he had committed any new crimes: and, That if he kept any commerce with <hi>Vieux-Pont,</hi> it was about ≈øome matters of Gallantry in <hi>Flauders,</hi> and not Affairs of State: That if they thought it proceeded from the Advice of <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> that he ≈øtuck to his Marriage, they were mightily deceived: and, That neither <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> nor any other man in the World, ≈øhou'd make him give his con≈øent to a Thing which he believ'd to be again≈øt his con≈øcience. This unalterable Re≈øolution of <hi>Ga≈øton</hi> ≈øtrangely perplex'd the Cardinal, who cou'd not endure to ≈øee him married to a Prince≈øs who≈øe family he had ≈øo lately ruin'd. It was likewi≈øe no ≈ømall Mortification to the Mini≈øter, that People laugh'd at the <hi>Arre≈øt</hi> which he had ≈øent to the Parliament, by which they were to declare, that Mon≈øieur cou'd not contract a Marriage in <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> return'd to <hi>Blou;</hi> from which place, merely for his Diver≈øion, he took a Journey as far as <hi>Nantes,</hi> which made the Court believe that he went thither to ≈øhip him≈øelf for <hi>England;</hi> but his Return di≈ø≈øipated the Fears they began to entertain that he wou'd go out of the Kingdom again. In the mean time <hi>Puilaurens</hi> died at <hi>Vincennes</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The fir≈øt of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note>, after a few days ≈øickne≈øs, which his Vexation, as well as his clo≈øe Impri≈øonment, threw him into. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was extreamly concern'd at the News; and this was the ≈øecond of his Favourites whom the Cardinal had caus'd to die in Pri≈øon, without convicting them of any other crime than that unpardonable one of not being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoted to his Plea≈øure. Few people regretted the death of <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> who≈øe Pride and Arrogance had render'd him in≈øupportable to all Mankind. Ever ≈øince his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement the Court had given Mon≈øieur a Council, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed of ≈øuch per≈øons as had an entire Dependence upon the Cardinal. <hi>Bouthillier</hi> was the chief of it, with the Title of Chancellour; and the others were the Abbot of <hi>Elbene, Goulas</hi> his Secretary, and the Abbot of <hi>La Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere</hi> his Chaplain.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Cardinal ≈øummon'd the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> to meet at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the King ≈øent to the A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54967:65"/>to know of them what were their Sentiments concerning the Marriages of the Princes of the Blood, who might pretend to the Succe≈ø≈øion of the Crown, and particularly of tho≈øe that ≈øtood neare≈øt to it, when they were made not only without his Maje≈øty's con≈øent, but even again≈øt his expre≈øs Prohibition. Upon this the A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly deputed certain Bi≈øhops to con≈øult about this Affair, with ≈øeveral Divines, both Regulars and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. The≈øe Bi≈øhops having<note n="*" place="margin">The 6th of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> made their Report to the A≈ø≈øembly, they return'd their An≈øwer the next day, ju≈øt as the Cardinal de≈øired, That Marriages might be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd null, by ancient Cu≈øtoms granted upon Rea≈øon, and authorized by the Church: That the Cu≈øtom of <hi>France</hi> did not allow the Princes of the Blood, but e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Pre≈øumptive Heirs of the Crown, to marry without the King's Con≈øent, and much le≈øs again≈øt his po≈øitive Commands: That Marriages of this nature were illegitimate and void, for want of an e≈ø≈øential Condition, without which Princes cou'd not marry law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: That this Cu≈øtom of <hi>France</hi> was rea≈øonable, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, e≈øtabli≈øhed by a legal Pre≈øcription, and authorized by the Church. The Queen-Mother having received Advice of this Declaration, writ to <hi>Rome</hi> to de≈øire his Holine≈øs to forbid the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> to interpo≈øe in this Affair; becau≈øe it was notorious to all the World, that this Convocation was almo≈øt wholly compo≈øed of Court-Bi≈øhops, who to advance their own Fortunes, were ready to ≈øay every thing the King and his Mini≈øter wou'd have them; and that if it was the King's Plea≈øure, nay if one of his Mini≈øters was of a different Opinion, they wou'd find no Difficulty to frame another Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directly oppo≈øite to the former.</p>
               <p>Le≈øt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might obtain of the Pope a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration contrary to that of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> or le≈øt his Holine≈øs might expre≈øs his Di≈ølike of it,<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">The 12th of <hi>October.</hi>

The Contents of this Letter principally related to the War, from which the Queen endeavour'd to di≈ø≈øwade her Son by all manner of Arguments.

Hitherto you have been the Arbitrator of Peace and War, but ≈øo ≈øoon as you quit the Quality of a Judge for that of a Party, neither of the two will any longer depend upon you.

All that they cou'd draw from him was, That if the Pope declared he might marry again in Con≈øcience, he wou'd do whatever the King de≈øired of him: probably becau≈øe he knew the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> wou'd never con≈øent to it. He only expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in this manner when he was at Court; for when he was at home, he did not ≈øpeak a word, not daring to open his mind to any of tho≈øe that were about him, whom he knew to be the Cardinal's Creatures. He often appeared extreamly thoughtful and melancholy, ≈øo that nothing cou'd divert him.</p>
               <p>People remark'd another thing at Court, which was, That the Cardinal had ≈øo ordered Affairs that the Privy-Council met at his Palace at <hi>Ruel,</hi> whither the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf was u≈øed to come from <hi>S. Germain</hi> or <hi>Ver≈øailles.</hi> It is true indeed, he excu≈øed it upon the ≈øcore of his Illne≈øs, but as his Indi≈øpo≈øition was not ≈øo great but he cou'd walk out in his Garden, ≈øeveral per≈øons were of opinion that he was afraid of being in a place where he was not the ≈øtronge≈øt. If he went at any time to <hi>S. Germain,</hi> it was at ≈øuch times as no body cou'd tell whether he wou'd go thither or no, as if he did it purpo≈øely to break any mea≈øures that might be taken again≈øt him. But after all, if the King was re≈øolved to de≈øtroy him, all the≈øe precautions were u≈øele≈øs; for he had found in a moment, all the Court and Kingdom upon his hands. The Princes of the Blood whom he treated ≈øo di≈øre≈øpectfully, and the People whom he daily oppre≈ø≈øed with new Impo≈øts and Taxes, equally hated him, and nothing was capable to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54967:67"/>≈øave him. Thus this mighty Authority, founded whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the King's Weakne≈øs, and a perpertual ≈øeries of Acts of Violence, was attended with no little Inquietude.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Cardinal, being re≈øolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve his po≈øt by the ≈øame ways as he had hitherto u≈øed, continued to act with the ≈øame heat again≈øt the Queen-Mother. As ≈øoon as he knew that Abbot <hi>Fabbroni</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> in Quality of Re≈øident from the Queen-Mother, he complain'd of it to the Pope by the Count <hi>de Noailles,</hi> who told him, That the Queen-Mother not being a Soveraign, but a Subject of the King, had no right to keep a Re≈øident at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that ≈øhe ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe to the Amba≈ø≈øadour of <hi>France.</hi> The Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, that ≈øimple Bi≈øhops had their Agents there, and that there were ≈øeveral Examples of the like nature. But whether he ≈øent to inform <hi>Fabbroni</hi> of it, or whether the latter was afraid of having ≈øome Affront put upon him, he retired immediately to <hi>Florence,</hi> and thus eas'd the Cardinal of the trouble to get him removed from that place.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54967:68"/>without ever de≈øigning to effect it: That they made no Scruple to overturn all Laws, both Divine and Humane, to fly directly in the face of the Apo≈øtolick Authority, and to violate the Sacraments of the Church, by their endeavouring to break off the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> That ≈øhe de≈øir'd the Pope to allow her the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep a Re≈øident, to give him an Account of all that ≈øhe knew, which might facilitate a General Peace: That the Cardinal abundantly di≈øcovered his Hatred and Malice again≈øt her by ≈øeeking to rob her of an Honour which belonged to her: That the King had no hand in the≈øe Violences, and that he dur≈øt not open his mind to tho≈øe that were about him, who were all gained over to the Cardinal by Bribes, or el≈øe aw'd out of their Duty by the fear of puni≈øhment: That he attempted by his Threats to gain an Ab≈øolute power over his Holine≈øs; but that ≈øhe cou'd a≈ø≈øure the Pope, that although the Cardinal was capable of all ≈øorts of Wickedne≈øs, yet he was of ≈øo fearful a Temper, that he dur≈øt never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ≈øo horrible and ≈øo impious an Attempt as that was with which he had threaten'd him, <hi>She means his de≈øign perhaps to make him≈øelf Patriarch of France:)</hi> That the Emperour and Catholick King had not condemn'd the Affection ≈øhe expre≈øs'd towards <hi>France,</hi> nor di≈øapproved of her De≈øires of a Peace, but on the contrary, had e≈øteem'd her the more for it: That the Cardinal wou'd rather con≈øent to have all <hi>France</hi> embroil'd, than ≈øuffer her to concern her ≈øelf about a Peace. In the whole cour≈øe of this Letter, ≈øhe repre≈øents the King as more depending upon his Mini≈øter than the Mini≈øter upon him, although ≈øhe ≈øeems de≈øirous to excu≈øe the King all along.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54967:71"/>a ≈øhort time all about <hi>Paris.</hi> This ≈øufficiently di≈øcovered how ≈ølightly the Cardinal had engag'd him≈øelf in a War, which was not to be managed like a Court-Intrigue, by Tricks, and putting Chimera's into the King's Head.</p>
               <p>But the Imperiali≈øts, in≈øtead of ≈øpeedily executing the De≈øign which had been propo≈øed to enter into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Champagne,</hi> lo≈øt a great deal of time unprofitably. <hi>Galas</hi> retired to <hi>Sarbruck</hi> till the re≈øt came up to him, where he in a manner block'd up <hi>Mentz, Creut≈ønack,</hi> and other Places belonging to the <hi>Swedes;</hi> but this was nothing in compari≈øon of what the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Army might have done, if they had gone immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Champagne.</hi> In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> marched to cover <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and hinder'd <hi>Galas</hi> from making any Attempts on that ≈øide: nay, he offer'd to force this General to re-pa≈øs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> if they would ≈øpeedily ≈øend him 3000 Hor≈øe and 15000 Foot.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal, who was afraid that the Imperiali≈øts wou'd take tho≈øe Advantages which their Numbers as well as the Opportunity it ≈øelf had put into their hands, told his tru≈øty Confident Father <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> 
                  <q>That he ≈øaw the Kingdom was in a very dangerous condition, and that he knew not what Remedies to apply to it; that the Levies that had been rai≈øed, dwindled to nothing in a ≈øhort time; and, that there was no Fidelity or Truth in the Officers: That there were not Forces enough to oppo≈øe the Imperial Armies if they joyn'd to make their way into <hi>France;</hi> and that the 12000 <hi>Switzers,</hi> and the ≈øame number of <hi>French</hi> which he gave Orders to be rai≈øed, could not be got ready before the Month of <hi>September:</hi> That if the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> had not ≈øtop'd the Progre≈øs of <hi>Galas, Lorrain</hi> had been already lo≈øt, with the three Bi≈øhopricks of <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun.</hi>
                  </q> This Capuchin, whom a little matter could not a≈øtoni≈øh, told the Cardinal, that he mu≈øt take Courage, and particularly apply him≈øelf to beat <hi>Galas</hi> back: That he mu≈øt place another General over the Army in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> re-inforce it as well as he cou'd, and hinder the Cheats of the Officers: That la≈øtly, he mu≈øt keep up and cultivate the Alliance with the <hi>Switzers,</hi> that ≈øo he might be furni≈øhed with Men from thence, and that this wou'd be ≈øo much the ea≈øier done, becau≈øe their Pen≈øions were not paid them by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

               <p>The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> joyn'd the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> after this. This latter, although he was a <hi>Lutheran,</hi>

                  </note> gave him the Right-hand, becau≈øe he rather con≈øidered the great credit he was in with the Mini≈øter of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. than his Dignity of Cardinal.

But it was one of the Mini≈øter's Maxims, To employ Bi≈øhops and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54967:72"/>Abbots in things that had no relation to their Function, whether he had a greater e≈øteem for Eccle≈øia≈øticks than he had for the Laity, or whether he thought they wou'd ≈øerve him with more punctuality.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Galas</hi> had be≈øieged <hi>Deuxponts,</hi> which place he had brought to ≈øurrender the next day, when he received Advice, that the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> were marching towards him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.

However, they advanced by the ≈øide of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and obliged 14000 Imperiali≈øts to rai≈øe the Siege of that City,<note place="margin">The 5th of <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi>
                  </note> which the Enemy had reduced to ≈øuch Extremities that they mu≈øt have been forced to ≈øurrender in four or five days for want of Provi≈øions.</p>
               <p>A few days after, <hi>Galas</hi> having re-united all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Forces that were about the <hi>Rhine</hi> into one Body, he formed an Army of them con≈øi≈øting of 30000 Men; and finding him≈øelf ≈øuperiour in numbers to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and the Duke, obliged them to retire in their turn. But it was impo≈ø≈øible for them to ≈øub≈øi≈øt longer in the place where they were, by rea≈øon that <hi>Francford</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the Emperour, and Sickne≈ø≈øes having got into the Army, had le≈ø≈øen'd it con≈øiderably. Now the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was, how to make a ≈øafe Retreat, before an Army much ≈øtronger than their own: They made an account to march ≈øtraight to <hi>Sarbruck,</hi> and to <hi>St. Avaud,</hi> where there was plenty of Provi≈øions; but <hi>Galas</hi> having cut off that way from them, they mu≈øt re≈øolve to take that of the Mountains, although un-peopled and without Refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and endeavour to reach <hi>Vaudervange,</hi> where there was a <hi>French</hi> Garri≈øon. They took this Road, labouring under all the≈øe Inconveniences, without daring to make a Halt at any place, either by rea≈øon of the great want of Victuals, or out of fear of having <hi>Galas</hi> upon their hands, this General following them very clo≈øely. At la≈øt they arrived, on the 26th of <hi>September,</hi> at <hi>Vaudervange,</hi> without any other lo≈øs than that of their Artillery, which the bad Weather, and the ≈øwiftne≈øs of their March, obliged them to leave behind.

He likewi≈øe pa≈ø≈øed it on the 28th, and found that the <hi>French</hi> had abandoned their Baggage, to retire under the Cannon of <hi>Metz.</hi> He advanc'd within a League and half of this City; but finding the Enemy ≈øecure, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his Army back again into the Country of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> within ≈øome Leagues of that place.

               <p>In the mean time <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, with a Body of Men under his Command, to re-po≈ø≈øe≈øs him≈øelf of his Dominions, where ≈øome of his Subjects received him with great joy: But as all the ≈øtrong Places were in the King's hands, it was impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to make any progre≈øs, by rea≈øon of the great Oppo≈øition he found from the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Force</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Angoul√™me.</hi> And thus after ≈øome Incur≈øions, and a few Skirmi≈øhes, he retired to joyn him≈øelf to <hi>Galas.</hi>

               <p>For the≈øe Rea≈øons, the Cardinal thought it the be≈øt way to prevent the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> in declaring open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again≈øt <hi>Spain,</hi> to hinder her from a≈ø≈øi≈øting the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and to give new Life and Vigour to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Swedes.</hi> To this end, he took great pains to form a League again≈øt <hi>Spain,</hi> both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give her ≈øo much Bu≈øine≈øs at home, that ≈øhe ≈øhou'd not have lei≈øuro to look abroad and interpo≈øe in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Germany.</hi>

Nay ≈øome people add, That if he had only lodged him≈øelf upon the Banks of the <hi>Rhine</hi> between <hi>Cleves</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Schenk,</hi> he might have reduced it in ten days: but he was ≈øo much afraid that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wou'd oblige him to fight them, that he came into the <hi>Betawe</hi> with his Army to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from any ≈øuch Attempt. 'Tis true indeed, he hinder'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the ≈øame time from piercing too far into the Territories of the States, which wou'd have cau≈øed a prodigious Di≈øorder.</p>

               <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was now ≈øen≈øible that the De≈øign of entring the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> by the way of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> which was the opinion of the two Mare≈øchals, was ill grounded, by rea≈øon of the great di≈øtance of the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> and that it had been much better to attack <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had advi≈øed. But now it was too late to remedy this fault. The King, who was made at fir≈øt to expect Miracles from this great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, was mightily concerned that it ≈øucceeded ≈øo ill, although care was taken to conceal a great part of their Lo≈ø≈øes from him. It ≈øo fell out, that a Gentleman whom the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ≈øent to him, having informed him of the particulars, he fell into an exce≈ø≈øive pa≈ø≈øion again≈øt <hi>Bouthillier,</hi> called him a Lyer, and forbid him to open any Packet but in his pre≈øence. This ≈øate ≈øo hard upon him, that his Mini≈øter fell ≈øick upon it, and the Cardinal him≈øelf appear'd very pen≈øive about it. At la≈øt they were ordered to ≈øave the re≈øt of the Army as well as they cou'd, but e≈øpecially the Hor≈øe. <hi>Charnac√©</hi> who came from the Army to <hi>Paris,</hi> was ordered to return into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to endeavour to conduct it from thence.</p>
               <p>While the Cardinal thus treated with the States-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral about the manner of attacking the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> the Pre≈øident <hi>de Bellievre,</hi> Amba≈ø≈øadour Extraordinary to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> formed a League with ≈øome of them to fall on the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> and to defend the Liberty of <hi>Italy</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> engaged them≈øelves in this League for three years; but the other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> wou'd not be concerned in it.

It was concluded, that the Duke

               <p>After this League was ≈øigned,<note place="margin">Siri, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 292.</note> the Mare≈øchal entred into the Territories of <hi>Spain</hi> on the 29th of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> with the French Troops; and having taken ≈øome incon≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Places, he went to inve≈øt <hi>Valence,</hi> upon the <hi>Po,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Orders from the King, or the Duke of <hi>Savoy. Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> took the Field the next day, a≈ø≈øi≈øted by an experienc'd French Captain, who≈øe name was <hi>de la Marne,</hi> whom Mare≈øchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> had ≈øent to direct him. He joyned him ≈øoon after, after he had routed a ≈ømall Body of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that pretended to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe his March. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made a longer ≈øtay before he came to the Rendezvouz; and as the Siege of <hi>Valence</hi> was not as yet perfectly formed, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had an opportunity to throw four thou≈øand Men into the Town, commanded by the Marqui≈øs <hi>de Celada,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the Garri≈øon. <hi>Francis del Cardine</hi> was Governour of this place, a≈ø≈øi≈øted by Captain <hi>Spadini,</hi> a Man of great Courage and Conduct.</p>
               <p>After this, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ≈øent his Troops to the Camp, and the Mare≈øchal began to carry on the Siege. he imagined that he ≈øhou'd be able to carry the Place in a few days, although the Be≈øieged ≈øallied out continually, and added ≈øome new Works to the ancient Fortifications. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Men, who had never been in any War before, daily dimini≈øhed; and as for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he made ≈øome difficulty of going in Per≈øon to this Siege, as being undertaken again≈øt his Advice, and begun by another. The Mare≈øchal <hi>de Thoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> out of Envy to <hi>Crequi,</hi> di≈ø≈øwaded him from going thither; but at la≈øt, at the In≈øtances of <hi>Emery,</hi> Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Turin,</hi> he arrived at the Camp on the 13th of <hi>October;</hi> and after he had vi≈øited the Works, he was of opinion that the Siege wou'd come to nothing; and in truth this unhappy Mi≈øunder≈øtanding between them ruined all their De≈øigns.</p>
               <p>The Mare≈øchal having received Advice that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh Army, commanded by Don <hi>Carlo Colonna,</hi> was on
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54967:79"/>their March to endeavour to rai≈øe the Siege, ≈øent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire the Duke to order his Men to pa≈øs the <hi>Po,</hi> that ≈øo they might fight the Enemy before they were intrenched at <hi>Fre≈øcarolo.</hi> But the Troops of the Duke pa≈ø≈øed ≈øo ≈ølow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were forced to ≈øend them back the next day. It was ≈øtill believed, that it wou'd be their be≈øt way to go and attack the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> ≈øo the Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward, the Mare≈øchal being in the Vanguard, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Body of the Battel, and the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in the Rear. The Enemy had taken no care to entrench them≈øelves, thinking that the French dur≈øt not ≈øtir out of their Lines to meet an Army ≈øtronger than their own, and they began already to retire when they were attacked. <hi>Crequi</hi> had the Right, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> commanded on the Left: The Attack began on the Duke's ≈øide with a great deal of Vigour, although they had not ≈øent to ob≈øerve the ground where the Enemy lay. They were beaten back into the Vineyards, where their Infantry was po≈øted, and they di≈øputed the ground very weakly, when <hi>Crequi,</hi> upon a fal≈øe Information, ≈øent word to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were entrenched on the other ≈øide, and ≈øuperiour to them in number, upon which he did not think it ≈øafe to pu≈øh it on any farther. This occa≈øioned <hi>Victor-Amadeo,</hi> who had already di≈ølodged the Spani≈øh Infantry out of the Vineyards, to ≈øound a Retreat, and lo≈øe a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of beating the Enemy. It is reported, that <hi>Crequi</hi> ≈øu≈øpected that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> only de≈øigned to engage him, to ≈øuffer him afterwards to be cut in pieces, and that for this rea≈øon he did not attack them. He retired likewi≈øe at the ≈øame time, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them≈øelves as good as beaten, were ≈øurprized to ≈øee the Enemy abandon, of their own accord, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize which had begun ≈øo well. This News they learn'd of the Pri≈øoners, but then it was too late; for after this the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entrenched them≈øelves, and were always upon their Guard. Nor was this all; for they threw fre≈øh Succours into the City through a place where the Lines of Circumvallation were not compleated, and where the <hi>Savoyards</hi> did not make any manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance. Another Supply enter'd the Town by the <hi>Po,</hi> after which the Rains that u≈øually fall in the Autumn,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54967:79"/>incommoded the Be≈øiegers. The Army which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe exceedingly weakned, by Weakne≈ø≈øes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øertions, and the mutual jealou≈øies between the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> ≈øtill increa≈øing, they began to talk of rai≈øing the Siege, as they did the next day, leaving their Canon, and part of their Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. The Generals drew off, complaining one of another, and that the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> which they had wi≈øely ≈øhared between them≈øelves before-hand, ≈øtill continued in the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal who had believed the Conque≈øt of it to be a matter of ≈ømall Difficulty, was exceedingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at the ill ≈øucce≈øs of this enterprize, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal Accu≈øations of the Duke and the Mare≈øchal, which afterwards came to him, gave him but little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation. <hi>Crequi</hi> accu≈øed the Duke with holding private Intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Duke made it appear that the Mare≈øchal had undertaken this Siege with too ≈ømall an Army, and ≈øhow'd no Conduct in the whole Affair, whatever Bravery he might otherwi≈øe have.</p>
               <p>He that was the mo≈øt in Danger, was the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who≈øe Territories lay expo≈øed to the revenge of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He complain'd that he was the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon that had ob≈øerved the Treaty, both in regard to the number of his Troops, the time appointed, and to his Zeal in executing with Vigour the projects that had been concerted in the Council of War. To prevent the ruine of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and fru≈øtrate the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Troops of <hi>France</hi> took their Winter Quarters in <hi>Italy,</hi> and were di≈øtributed into ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Garri≈øons.</p>
               <p>Thus the Cardinal's great Expectations of conquering the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> vani≈øh'd on the ≈øudden, although 'tis certain that he cou'd not have cho≈øen a fitter time for this enterprize, if it had been well executed, for the King had made him≈øelf Ma≈øter of the Pa≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline</hi> beforchand, to hinder any Troops from coming to the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p>The Mini≈øter did not much trouble him≈øelf what the World thought of the≈øe exactions, ≈øo long as they brought in Money.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers advi≈øed to di≈øpatch him out of the way, for that would ≈øoon put an end to all the≈øe di≈øorders: This la≈øt expedient ≈øeemed the be≈øt, and the two Princes being re≈øolved to put it in execution, tru≈øted the Secret with four per≈øons, one of whom was a Dome≈øtick of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur,</hi> and the other three belonged to the Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons.</hi>

               <p>During the Siege of <hi>Corbie,</hi> the King Lodged in a Ca≈øtle near <hi>Amiens,</hi> and never came to the City, where the Cardinal lay, but when he held a Council there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he returned to this Ca≈øtle. So <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> and the Count re≈øolved, one day when they came to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to carry a great number of the Officers of the Army
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54967:89"/>along with them, and that ≈øo ≈øoon as the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Quarters, to find ≈øome pretence or other to ≈øtop the Cardinal, and cau≈øe him to be Murder'd by the Four Men, who knew of the Affair. With this de≈øign they came to the City, and the Council being over, the King retired according to his Cu≈øtom. One of the Four Con≈øpirators coming up to the Duke and the Count, as if he had ≈øomething to ≈øay to them, asked in their Ear, Whether they ≈øtill continued in this Re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? They an≈øwer'd, Yes: So this Man made a Sign for the others to approach, at the time when the two Princes were di≈øcour≈øing with the Cardinal at the bottom of the Stair-ca≈øe of the Council-Chamber. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remained for the Duke to doe, but onely to give the≈øe Fellows the Signal, and then the Cardinal had been certainly kill'd, without any po≈ø≈øibility of e≈øcaping. But at this moment the Duke leaving the Cardinal with the Count, began to go up the Stairs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Hall in a great confu≈øion: One of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpirators immediately followed him, and would have pulled him back, but the Duke never ≈øtopt till he was got up to the top.</p>
               <p>It was to no purpo≈øe for this Man to repre≈øent to him, That he had lo≈øt the faire≈øt opportunity in the World, and that nothing had been ≈øo ea≈øie as to accompli≈øh it: The Duke was ≈øo ≈øtrangely di≈øorder'd, that he could make him no po≈øitive An≈øwer, but expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in confu≈øed and doubtful Terms. The Count ≈øtill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Cardinal in Conver≈øation; one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpirators being behind him, and the other two at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle di≈øtance off; but <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> not returning, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal began to fear there was ≈øome de≈øign again≈øt his Per≈øon; and taking his leave of the Count, got into his Coach, and went home. He did not know till ≈øome time after, the circum≈øtances of the danger he had been in; but from that moment he would never tru≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf more in the hands of his Enemies. The≈øe Princes afterwards pretended, That when they were upon the point of having him A≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øinated, they were hinder'd from doing it, by con≈øidering, that the Cardinal was a Prie≈øt: a weak Rea≈øon to put by the Execution of a Lawful De≈øign, if this was one, and which did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54967:90"/>the Crime much more heinous, if they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this action to be a crime, as really it was. Be≈øides, it was not at that very Moment when they de≈øign'd to kill the Cardinal, that they fir≈øt learnt he was a Prie≈øt: no, they knew that long before; and if that rea≈øon was good, it ought to have di≈ø≈øwaded them at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from falling upon ≈øuch a De≈øign. But tho≈øe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had engaged the≈øe Princes in this Affair, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted this ≈øudden change to the natural weakne≈øs of <hi>Mon≈øieur,</hi> which rendred him equally uncapable of good and bad actions, when they required any force of Mind or Re≈øolution.</p>
               <p>Having failed of this blow, the Duke and the Count took the other way which had been propo≈øed, to ruin the Cardinal in the King's good opinion of him. To effect this more ea≈øily, they endeavour'd to engage the Dukes of <hi>E≈øpernon, la Valette, Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Rets</hi> in their De≈øign, and they ≈øent Me≈ø≈øengers to them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe; but they onely di≈øcover'd their thoughts by this means, without ≈øtrengthening their party. The Cardinal who was inform'd of it, judged that the be≈øt way to ≈øupport him≈øelf again≈øt them, and to be revenged of 'em, was to remove them from the Court, by making fal≈øe Advice be given them, That the King de≈øign'd to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. Thus being gone to <hi>Paris</hi> by the King's Order, on the 18th of <hi>November,</hi> while the Cardinal was ≈øtill in <hi>Picardy,</hi> he Alarm'd them ≈øo dexterou≈øly with this fal≈øe news, that on the 20th, or 21≈øt of <hi>November</hi> at Night, both of them made their E≈øcapes. <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Blois,</hi> without ≈øeeing the King, and the Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons</hi> to <hi>Sedan,</hi> without taking his leave of him.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as they had left the Court, it was no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter for the Cardinal to per≈øwade the King what he plea≈øed; but when His Maje≈øty came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the≈øe Princes gave it out publickly, That the rea≈øon of their going away, was, becau≈øe there was a de≈øign to apprehend them, he was extreamly offended at it; and, in reality, he had never thought of any ≈øuch thing. <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> ≈øent a very ≈øubmi≈ø≈øive.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>As for the Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons,</hi> who was of a more haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ≈øpirit, he ≈øent the King a Letter full of Reproaches; wherein he complained, That, in ≈øtead of a Reward for the ≈øervices he had done him, he found him≈øelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrain'd to fly for Sanctuary to one of his Friends, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Impri≈øonment.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54967:91"/>the welfare of the Kingdom. The King de≈øired, that <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> would oblige him≈øelf to the performance of this, by ≈øigning a Promi≈øe that was drawn up, and ≈øent to him. As for what concerned the Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons, Chavigny</hi> inform'd him what Me≈ø≈øage His Maje≈øty had ≈øent to him. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> appear'd to be well enough pleas'd, and told him, He was ready to ≈øign the Promi≈øe that was propo≈øed to him; but, he would not wholly conclude it, till he had Written to the Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons,</hi> if it were onely for form ≈øake. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe de≈øired, that <hi>Du Fargis, Coudrai-Montpen≈øier,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>la Riviere,</hi> who had lately been ≈øent to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, ≈øhould be ≈øet at liberty. This, though it was not wholly refu≈øed, yet they intimated to him, that it would be much more proper to ask the≈øe Favours of the King, after he had entirely adju≈øted all differences with him. The Abbot of <hi>la Riviere</hi> indeed was ≈øoon after relea≈øed from his Confinement, becau≈øe he promi≈øed to joyn with <hi>Goulas,</hi> the Duke's Secretary, who was of the Cardinal's Party, to per≈øwade <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> to doe what the Mini≈øter de≈øired of him. As for a place of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they thought it by no means fitting to grant him one; and, unle≈øs they granted that, the Duke was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they would not keep their words with him. Some of his Dome≈øticks put that into his head, as al≈øo to ≈øtick firm to the Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons,</hi> from who≈øe Intere≈øts the Court endeavoured to di≈øengage him. As he was naturally incon≈øtant and irre≈øolute, he ≈øometimes ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inclin'd to make his own Agreement by him≈øelf; yet Writ at the ≈øame time to the Count, who had invited him to <hi>Sedan,</hi> that he de≈øign'd to come and joyn him. But at la≈øt the Offers of the Court, and the Advice of tho≈øe about him that favour'd it, determined him, for ≈øome time, to make his Reconciliation without the Count, and to feign him≈øelf ≈øick of the Gout, that he might not go to <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time ≈øeveral of tho≈øe per≈øons who had been in the party of <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> came to <hi>Blois,</hi> and <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi>'s Court increa≈øed every day.

               <p>The King and Cardinal looked upon the≈øe Preten≈øions of <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> to be extravagant, e≈øpecially what related to the Places of Security, which they thought the≈øe Princes demanded for no other rea≈øon, but to be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, upon the fir≈øt occa≈øion of Di≈øcontent they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to receive, to introduce the Enemies of the Crown into the Bowels of <hi>France.</hi> So they were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the King enlarged the Chevalier <hi>de Grignan</hi> out of the <hi>Ba≈øtile,</hi> who had a great A≈øcendant over <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur,</hi> hoping that when he was near his Per≈øon, he might counter-balance the Credit of tho≈øe who per≈øwaded him to demand a place of ≈øecurity.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54967:92"/>at Court, that <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> was ≈øo effectually led by the in≈øtigation of others, that they did not que≈øtion but that if tho≈øe that were about him would advi≈øe him to put him≈øelf into the King's hands, without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stipulations, he would immediately come and do it.</p>
               <p>About the middle of <hi>January</hi> they ≈øent him word, That His Maje≈øty would grant him all the Securities he could de≈øire, but that he was willing to ≈øee an end of this Affair. Upon this <hi>Mon≈øieur</hi> di≈øpatched F. <hi>Gondran,</hi> his Confe≈ø≈øor, to Court, with demands like tho≈øe he had made before.

The Three Leagues made a Treaty at <hi>In≈øpruck,</hi> with the Marqui≈øs <hi>de Leganez,</hi> and the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> for the execution of this De≈øign.</p>
               <p>On the day appointed for it, the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> abandon'd the Po≈øts, which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had given them to keep. One part of them entred into <hi>Coire,</hi> to ≈øecure that City again≈øt the <hi>French,</hi> and the re≈øt po≈øitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed to obey any other Officers, but tho≈øe that were nominated by the Leagues. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> finding him≈øelf ≈øomewhat better, went to all places to appea≈øe them, and by his repeated in≈øtances at la≈øt obtain'd of them to ≈øtay two Months, to give the King time to ≈øatisfie them. In the mean time, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put them≈øelves in a po≈øture to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the <hi>Gri≈øons;</hi> if they ≈øhou'd have occa≈øion for them; and the≈øe two Months pa≈ø≈øed and two Months more, and yet through the Cardinal's Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, no Money came from <hi>France,</hi> though the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> repre≈øented to him the great Danger he was in, if ≈øome cour≈øe was not taken to pay the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> what was due to them. It ≈øeems the Cardinal had a De≈øign to ruine the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> by ≈øuffering him to lo≈øe the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and to throw the fault at la≈øt wholly upon him, in ca≈øe he did not peri≈øh there. At la≈øt, all the Country took up Arms on the 18th of <hi>March,</hi> and ≈øome of them run to the place where the Duke was, to apprehend him; but he immediately retir'd to the Fort <hi>du Rhine,</hi> not that it was in a Condition to defend it ≈øelf, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the fury of the People; who were provoked to the highe≈øt Degree, to ≈øee them≈øelves paid with nothing but fair Words. Nay, though the Fort had been in a ca≈øe of Defence, yet the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was not able to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54967:97"/>do any thing, becau≈øe it was kept by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who were fully re≈øolved to deliver him up. The <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> in≈øi≈øted, That the Duke ≈øhould immediately give Orders for the <hi>French</hi> Troops to goe out of their Country; but, as he had no Commi≈ø≈øion from the Court to doe it, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid le≈øt he ≈øhould ruine him≈øelf if he con≈øented to it. However, he was obliged ≈øpeedily to come to ≈øome re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or el≈øe to ≈øee the <hi>French,</hi> that were di≈øper≈øed in ≈øeveral places up and down the Country, Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>In this extremity he bethought him≈øelf of an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which, at the ≈øame time, ≈øaved his own honour, and the lives of his Souldiers. And that was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, That within Twenty days, reckoning from that on which the Treaty was Signed, he would Command them to quit the <hi>Valteline.</hi> But the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> not being content with that propo≈øal, he offer'd to goe to <hi>Coire,</hi> and there to ≈øtay as an Ho≈øtage, till the entire accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhmment of the Treaty. By hazarding his Per≈øon thus, the Duke ≈øaved his Army, and gave the<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> King time to ≈øend another General to the <hi>Valteline,</hi> through the States of <hi>Venice,</hi> if he thought it convenient, or if the Court was minded to abandon this Country, they might do it then with more honour, than if the Duke had given Orders for his Troops to remove, when the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> would have had him doe it.</p>
               <p>In this conjuncture the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> to deliver up the Duke to them, for fear he ≈øhould make his e≈øcape; but the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> would by no means con≈øent to that, but rather cho≈øe to keep him, as a Pri≈øoner of War, but would not give him leave to conver≈øe with any body. The term of Twenty days was expired, and yet no Order came from Court, the Cardinal being re≈øolved to take no notice of the matter. However the <hi>French</hi> Troops<note n="*" place="margin">The 5th of <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note> departed, the Forts were con≈øigned to the <hi>Gri≈øons,</hi> and the Duke ≈øet at liberty. The principal Per≈øons of the Country ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him as far as the Frontiers, as it were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe them≈øelves for the Violence that had been u≈øed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. After he had cro≈ø≈øed <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Troops to the Province of <hi>Gex,</hi> he left them in the hands of the Count <hi>de Guebriant</hi> Mare≈øchal de
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54967:98"/>Camp, and retired to <hi>Geneva,</hi> there to expect His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty's farther Orders. This Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was extreamly cen≈øured at Court, as if he had not been ≈øen≈øible that the Country would be infallibly lo≈øt, if they did not ≈øpeedily ≈øupply him with Money, and as if he had not acquainted them with all that happen'd. The Cardinal cau≈øed Two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Livres to be ≈øent to the Count <hi>de Guebriant,</hi> with Orders not to obey the Duke, but endeavour to re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Country, out of which he came, with his Troops, in ca≈øe the <hi>Venetians</hi> were willing to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him. But now it was too late, and the Pa≈ø≈øes were two well Guarded; ≈øo that the≈øe Troops, con≈øi≈øting in all of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Six thou≈øand Foot, and Seven hundred Hor≈øe, were ordered, part to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the re≈øt for <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to joyn the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> there. From that time the War which <hi>France</hi> made in <hi>Italy,</hi> was onely a ≈ølight diver≈øion for the Forces of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria;</hi> and it appeared, by what followed, that the Cardinal had no other de≈øign than that.</p>
               <p>This year Three Princes of Europe died, who≈øe death, it was to be feared, would occa≈øion great Di≈øorders. The fir≈øt was the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the II, who died on the 14th of <hi>February.</hi> His Son, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> the III, who had been already Elected King of the <hi>Romans</hi> ≈øucceeded him. The Cardinal, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon I don't know, would not ≈øuffer <hi>France</hi> to own him, either for the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or for Emperour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every thing had been done in the accu≈øtomed forms, and all the Catholick Princes, and the greate≈øt part of the Prote≈øtants had own'd him without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. And therefore <hi>France,</hi> which otherwi≈øe would have di≈øobliged the Electors extreamly, and ≈øeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, without any Nece≈ø≈øity, or the lea≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of an Advantage to be made by it, ≈øoon after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the III, as every one had done before them. The Affairs of the <hi>Swedes</hi> went ill enough this year in <hi>Germany;</hi> and <hi>Banier</hi> was content to put him≈øelf in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> after the Death of Duke <hi>Bogi≈ølaus</hi> the XIV, ≈øince he was not in a condition to mole≈øt the Imperiali≈øts.</p>

               <p>The ≈øecond Prince that died this year, was <hi>Charles Gonzaga,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> While he lived in <hi>France,</hi> as a<note n="‚Ä†" place="margin">

After he became a Soveraign, he ≈øeemed to bend under the weight of Affairs, and could not find any expedient to hinder the de≈øolation of his Countrey, either by the way of Arms, or that of Negotiation. He left his Dominions to <hi>Charles</hi> his Grand≈øon, born of the Duke of <hi>Rethel,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who was his Guardian.

               <p>The Third was <hi>Butos-Amadeo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who died the 7th of <hi>October.</hi> He was as much e≈øteem'd as any Prince of his time, for his Conduct both in Peace and War. The onely thing he is blamed for, was his weakne≈øs in ≈øuffering <hi>Mazarine</hi> to per≈øwade him to deliver up <hi>Pignerol</hi> to <hi>France;</hi> by which Surrendry he left his Territories on the other ≈øide the Mountains to their di≈øcretion and Mercy.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54967:99"/>whenever they thought fit. The≈øe con≈øiderations inclined Madam of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and her Council, to endeavour to make a Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> as ≈øoon as might be, to hinder the ruine of her Country. Be≈øides, ≈øhe di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, ≈øoon after the Death of the Duke her Husband, how little ≈øhe was to rely upon the Mini≈øters of the King her Brother. <hi>L'Emery,</hi> Amba≈ø≈øador of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Turin,</hi> de≈øign'd, with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>French</hi> Troops that were quarter'd about <hi>Verceil,</hi> where the Duke died, to ≈øeize upon the Per≈øon of the Dutche≈øs, and of the Princes her Sons, under a pretence to prevent the de≈øigns of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who would endeavour to engage this Prince≈øs in their Party, or at lea≈øt to ob≈øerve a Neutrality. The Amba≈ø≈øador propo≈øed this enterprize to the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> but the Mare≈øchal would not con≈øent to be the In≈øtrument of a violence of this nature, again≈øt a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and again≈øt Princes that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King's Protection. However, the Amba≈ø≈øador, who was perfectly well acquainted with the Cardinal-Duke's Temper; and knew, that in matters of State, abundance of things are approved of when done, which would not be allowed to be done, if leave was asked before-hand, did not, for all this, de≈øi≈øt from his De≈øign. But the Dutche≈øs happening to be informed of it, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Marqui≈øs <hi>de Ville</hi> with the Troops of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to enter into <hi>Verceil</hi> by night, and cau≈øed the Gates to be ≈øhut to ≈øeveral <hi>French</hi> Officers that came thither, under a pretence of Buying Victuals for their Souldiers. By this means ≈øhe fru≈øtrated this De≈øign, and the Troops of <hi>France</hi> had Orders to remove from <hi>Verceil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marqui≈øs <hi>de S. Maurice,</hi> Amba≈ø≈øador of <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> having received the News of the Death of the Duke his Ma≈øter, went to carry it to the King and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who promi≈øed to protect the young Duke, and the Durche≈øs, with all the Forces of the Kingdom. The Cardinal gave the Amba≈ø≈øador to under≈øtand, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of <hi>Emery</hi>'s de≈øign, that the King had no hand in it, and that he would go to a≈ø≈øi≈øt his Si≈øter in Per≈øon, if it were nece≈ø≈øary. At the ≈øame time he advi≈øed the Dutche≈øs to two things; one of them was, to put ≈øuch Subjects of the Duke, as ≈øhe was well a≈ø≈øured of, into all the Strong Places of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy:</hi> the other
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54967:99"/>was, To treat her Brother-in-Law with all the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imaginable, but not to ≈øuffer them to come into the Dominions of the Duke her Son. Upon this the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador told him, That the be≈øt way the Dutche≈øs could take to live at peace with all the World, would be to clap up a Peace with <hi>Spain:</hi> To which the Cardinal an≈øwer'd, That ≈øhe might expect from the King her Brother every thing that was for the advantage of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> even though it ≈øhould be again≈øt the Intere≈øt of the Crown, but that he did not ≈øee any ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in a particular Peace.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal afterwards made a Solemn Vi≈øit to the Amba≈ø≈øador; where, after the fir≈øt Compliments were over, he told him, <q>That he was ≈øurprized that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Savoy</hi> had any ≈øu≈øpicion of the <hi>French</hi> Troops, ≈øince the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> had immediately drawn them off from about <hi>Verceil,</hi> and conducted them to <hi>Ca≈øal:</hi> that he had di≈øcover'd, upon this occa≈øion, the inclination of ≈øome of her Coun≈øellors, that had advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed her to ≈øend with all expedition into <hi>Spain,</hi> which apparently tended to di≈øengage her from <hi>France;</hi> that he hoped a General Peace would be ≈øoon concluded, but that if the Dutche≈øs and her Council were too impatient, the King would not hinder her from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a particular accommodation by her ≈øelf, but that his honour would not permit him to abandon his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Allies.</q>

                  <hi>Savoy</hi> was de≈øirous at the ≈øame time to come into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to offer his Services to the young Duke and the Regent by word of Mouth: but ≈øhe de≈øired him to let it alone, for fear of giving any ≈øu≈øpicion to <hi>France,</hi> with whom he very well knew ≈øhe was obliged to manage her ≈øelf cautiou≈øly, ≈øince neither her Brother, nor her Husband, could have drawn the Indignation of that Court down upon them, without being con≈øiderable lo≈øers by the bargain. She likewi≈øe received Compliments from Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øs <hi>Palavicini.</hi> This Prince repre≈øented to her, That the <hi>French,</hi> under a ≈øhow of protecting her, might take the opportunity to ≈øeize upon <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that if <hi>Spain</hi> was induced to bring the War thither for that rea≈øon, the States of the Hou≈øe of <hi>Savoy</hi> would
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54967:100"/>be inevitably ruin'd: that therefore ≈øhe ought to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from making them≈øelves Ma≈øters of the Strong Places, that ≈øhe might not bring the≈øe inconveniences upon her Self; and that he was ready to come there, where his Pre≈øence would be nece≈ø≈øary, to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing them≈øelves of all: That the more ≈øhe was intere≈ø≈øed in the Pre≈øervation of the Princes her Children, ≈øo much the greater ha≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhould make to take the nece≈ø≈øary mea≈øures for ≈øuch a De≈øign; and ≈øo much the rather, becau≈øe it was vi≈øible that this War was not carried on for the Grandeur of the King her Brother, nor of his Kingdom, but to pre≈øerve the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in his pre≈øent Dignity.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of this year, the Cardinal percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the King was extreamly Melancholy, did all that he could to penetrate into the rea≈øon of it. As the King was able to conceal nothing from him, and all tho≈øe that approached His Maje≈øty, were his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, except the Confe≈ø≈øor, he came to know, that he was troubled with remor≈øe of Con≈øcience for ≈øuffering the Queen his Mother to be out of the Kingdom ≈øo long, after all the Submi≈ø≈øions ≈øhe had made him. This Prince, who had neither good nor bad inclinations of him≈øelf, but as they were put into him by others, was not capable of receiving ≈øuch a Scruple as that, all on the ≈øudden; and the Cardinal ≈øoon di≈øcover'd, that the Confe≈ø≈øor had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed him with it.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Father <hi>Cau≈ø≈øin,</hi> who had long deliberated upon the matter, and waited a favourable opportunity to open him≈øelf frankly to the King, again≈øt the Conduct of his Mini≈øter, thought he had now found it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repre≈øent to him all his Mi≈øcarriages, in the mo≈øt violent Expre≈ø≈øions he could think of. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that His Maje≈øty ought to Di≈øcard him for Four principal Rea≈øons. The fir≈øt was the Bani≈øhment
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54967:100"/>of the Queen-Mother, who was left in ≈øo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, that ≈øhe wanted even the Nece≈ø≈øaries of Life: and this Rea≈øon ≈øeemed to make ≈øome impre≈ø≈øion upon the King. The ≈øecond was, that the Cardinal u≈øurped all the Royal Authority, ≈øo that nothing remain'd to His Maje≈øty but the bare Name of King; and that the whole Nation had recour≈øe to him, as the ≈øupreme Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øer of all Favours. The third was, the Oppre≈ø≈øion of the People who were reduced to the la≈øt mi≈øery by the exorbitant Taxes. The fourth was, the Intere≈øt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which the Cardinal-Duke de≈øigned to annihilate, by ≈øupporting the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the Prote≈øtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> who through his means were become more formidable than ever.</p>
               <p>As ≈øoon as Father <hi>Cau≈ø≈øin</hi> had done talking, the King ≈øeemed to be moved by his Di≈øcour≈øe, which in reality contain'd nothing but notorious Truths, and ≈øuch as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in the Kingdom, to their co≈øt, were convinced of, but only him≈øelf. He appeared to be ≈øomewhat inclined to remove the Cardinal from the Mini≈øtry, if his Confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor cou'd have named any one to him, that was capable of ≈øucceeding him; but that was a point he never thought of, ≈øo unfit he was to manage an Affair of this con≈øequence. The King afterwards asked him, whether he wou'd ju≈øtifie before the Cardinal's face what he had then advanced again≈øt him. This Que≈øtion put the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuit to a ≈øtand; however he recover'd him≈øelf, and told him he wou'd make the Cardinal ≈øub≈øcribe to the truth of it, ≈øince he had ≈øaid nothing but what all the World knew to be ≈øo. The King replied, that he ≈øhou'd ≈øee him then, and appointed a day; which was the 8th of <hi>December.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Father <hi>Cau≈ø≈øin</hi> waited for this critical day, but found him≈øelf under ≈øtrange Anxieties, e≈øpecially when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that there was no Dependance upon the King's Re≈øolution, and that he mu≈øt expect terrible Things from the Mini≈øter's Indignation. After he had con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him≈øelf a long while what he was to do in this juncture, he re≈øolved to communicate the whole Affair to the Duke of <hi>Angoul√™me,</hi> and to propo≈øe to him to fill the place of fir≈øt Mini≈øter. The Duke going to vi≈øit him at the Hou≈øe of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> he made this Propo≈øal to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54967:101"/>him, which made him more a≈øtoni≈øhed at the Boldne≈øs of Father <hi>Cau≈ø≈øin,</hi> than de≈øirous to accept the Station he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him. However, pretending to be overcome by his Rea≈øons, he filled him with mighty hopes, and promis'd to ≈øupport him as far as he was able. The Je≈øuit was now impatient till the day appointed came, that he might in the Cardinal's pre≈øence make good the Accu≈øations he had laid again≈øt him. He expected to ≈øee the Cardinal fall into an outrageous Pa≈ø≈øion, but was re≈øolved to pu≈øh the Bu≈øine≈øs home, whatever it co≈øt him.</p>
               <p>But ≈øcarce had the Duke of <hi>Angoul√™me</hi> parted from him, but chu≈øing the ≈øure≈øt way, he po≈øted directly to <hi>Ruel</hi> to acquaint the Cardinal with what he had ≈øo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learn'd.

               <p>The Confe≈ø≈øor repaired to St. <hi>Germains</hi> on the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and came into the Anti-Chamber, as his u≈øual cu≈øtom was; where he was inform'd, that the King had ≈øhut him≈øelf up in his Clo≈øet with the Cardinal.

They had frequent Conferences together, which made the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal very unea≈øie, and it was reported, that the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> was to marry the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Rohan.</hi> The former, after he had taken ≈øome few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, went to be≈øiege <hi>Rhinfeld,</hi> the Capital of the four Forre≈øt Cities. <hi>Jean de Werth,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savelli,</hi> and the other Generals of the Emperour, marched to the relief of it with Ten Thou≈øand Men.

               </p>
               <p>While he inve≈øted this place, <hi>d' E≈øpernon</hi> took <hi>Pa≈ø≈øage,</hi> where he found Six <hi>Galleons,</hi> and Five <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Men of War, furni≈øhed with all manner of Provi≈øions, which he ≈øeized upon. Five more of their <hi>Galleons</hi> fell into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and the Admiral of this Fleet was ≈øunk. Nothing cou'd begin more happily than
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54967:107"/>this Affair, and there was very good rea≈øon to expect it wou'd ≈øucceed, becau≈øe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never imagined that the <hi>French</hi> wou'd attack them on the ≈øide of <hi>Guipu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa. Don Chri≈øtoforo Me≈ø≈øia,</hi> who had lately been made Governour of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> was not as yet come to his Government. The Garri≈øon which generally con≈øi≈øted of Five Hundred Men, cou'd ≈øcarce make Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the inhabitants joyning with them, cou'd not amount to above Seven Hundred fit to bear Arms.

The Prince open'd the Trenches on the 10th of <hi>July;</hi> and on the 2d of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, con≈øi≈øting of Forty Two Ve≈ø≈øels, full Mann'd with Soldiers that were to be ≈øet on Shore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Arch-bi≈øhop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Port of <hi>Fontarabia.</hi> They took immediately or put to Flight ≈øeveral <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Pinnaces that came there, and gave cha≈øe to a Fleet of Fifty Sail, that brought Succours and Refre≈øhments to the Be≈øieged. The Arch-bi≈øhop receiving Information, that in the Road of <hi>Gatari,</hi> there lay Forty Men of War, and ≈øeveral other ≈ømaller Ve≈ø≈øels, bore up to them, and ≈øome he Burnt, and others he forced to run a≈øhore, although they were defended with ≈øome Batteries, that were rai≈øed on purpo≈øe by the Sea-≈øide. Abundance of <hi>Spaniards</hi> were lo≈øt in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that were burnt in the Ships or Drowned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, the two old Regiments of <hi>Ca≈øtile,</hi> that made up about Three Thou≈øand Men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> on the other hand, lo≈øt in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not above Two hundred Men, with ≈øome Officers, and onely Nine or Ten of their Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øu≈øtained any damage.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Fontarabia</hi> lo≈øt all hopes of being relieved by Sea; and as for what Succours could come to it by Land, the Prince flatter'd him≈øelf that he might take it, before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could be in a condition to take the Field. The Arch-bi≈øhop, at his return from his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, offer'd to Guard the Port of <hi>Pa≈ø≈øage,</hi> and the Mouth of the River <hi>Orio,</hi> by which way the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might throw Succours into the Town. This Affair was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54967:108"/>in a Council of War, but as it could not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without dividing the Army, and they hoped to carry the place in a ≈øhort time, the Prince was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was the be≈øt way to abandon <hi>Pa≈ø≈øage,</hi> not con≈øidering what advantage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might make of this Po≈øt, if the Siege held much longer. In the mean time, the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Army, Commanded by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Ca≈øtile,</hi> came in ≈øight, and their Provi≈øions arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved principally to them by the means of the Port of <hi>Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage,</hi> which made them, now it was too late, ≈øee, the great over-≈øight they had committed. But the chief fault was, that the Prince, who was not much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in Sieges, had not pre≈øt the Works with that vigour as was requi≈øite. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the Tops of the Neighbouring Mountains, were within Mu≈øquet-≈øhot of the Advanced-Guards of the <hi>French,</hi> ≈øo that daily Skirmi≈øhes happened between the two Armies.</p>
               <p>Altho' the Garri≈øon was incon≈øiderable, as to its num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Commandant made ≈øeveral Sallies, to retard the Works of the <hi>French,</hi> and to give time for relief to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to them. Ar fir≈øt he had good ≈øucce≈øs in them, but making one more con≈øiderable than the re≈øt, at which time the <hi>French</hi> happen'd to be better upon their Guard than they u≈øed to be, they lo≈øt a Hundred Men, among whom was <hi>Michael Perez,</hi> who died of his Wounds in the place.</p>
               <p>At la≈øt the Garri≈øon was ≈øo much dimini≈øhed, that it held out onely in hopes, that the Cardinal of <hi>Ca≈øtile</hi> would come ≈øpeedily to relieve it; and, they ≈øent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, That if he did not make ha≈øt, they ≈øhould be obliged to Surrender, as not being in a condition to ≈øu≈øtain an A≈ø≈øault.</p>

Great Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were wholly depopulated, without any con≈øiderable advantages obtained, either on this, or t'other part, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ≈øatisfie the ambitious preten≈øions of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> or of the Cardinal, again≈øt the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria.</hi> The manner of their keeping this private Commerce, was as follows. The Cardinal Infanta's Letters were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a certain Nun of <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> who hid them in the Clo≈øet of an Oratory which the Queen had in that Convent, and whither ≈øhe frequently went. The Queen likewi≈øe left her own in the ≈øame place, and this Nun
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54967:110"/>took care to fetch, and give them to one <hi>la Porte,</hi> who ≈øent them to <hi>Bru≈ø≈øels.</hi> The Cardinal, who had more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons to ≈øpy, even the lea≈øt Actions of the King and Queen, than tho≈øe were to watch his own, came to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; and, as he looked upon a Peace, as a thing that would prove fatal to his Grandeur, he re≈øolved to break off this Corre≈øpondence, whatever it co≈øt him. He had effectually po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the King with deep prejudices again≈øt the Queen, ever ≈øince ≈øhe engaged her Self in Cabals oppo≈øite to his Authority, as I have el≈øewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved. So it was no difficult matter for him to make His Maje≈øty believe, how dangerous it was to ≈øuffer the Queen to Write to a Declared Enemy of the State. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore order'd <hi>la Porte</hi> to be apprehended, he was minded to Interrogate him him≈øelf, to effect which, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd to <hi>Chavigny</hi>'s Apartment, and threw him≈øelf upon his Bed; after he had order'd the Curtains to be drawn, that ≈øo he might di≈øcour≈øe him without being ≈øeen. Then <hi>la Porte</hi> was order'd to come into the Room, and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal began to que≈øtion him in a Counterfeit-Voice. But this new manner of examining a Pri≈øoner did not ≈øucceed as he imagin'd, for <hi>la Porte</hi> knew his Voice immediately, and ≈øtood upon his Guard. Upon this he order'd the Chancellor to go to <hi>Val de Grace</hi> to the Queen's Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and there to ≈øeize the Letters of Her Maje≈øty, and the Cardinal-Infanta. The Chancellor, however he was intirely devoted to him, yet, apprehen≈øive of what might hereafter happen to him from the Queen's part, was for finding out a way to obey the Cardinal, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Queen too much, and therefore gave her private Intimation of the Command he had received. This Prince≈øs having no body about her to Con≈øult in this ≈øtrange Conjuncture, ≈øent the Marchione≈øs <hi>de Sennecey</hi> to the Marqui≈øs <hi>de Puy≈øieux,</hi> who, ever ≈øince his Di≈øgrace, had lived at his Country-Hou≈øe, to demand his Advice upon this occa≈øion. He was ≈øomewhat troubled that the Queen ≈øhould Con≈øult him upon ≈øo nice an affair as this was, knowing the implacable humour of this Mini≈øter; but, at la≈øt, he could not refu≈øe to tell Her his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Matter.</p>
               <p>One day, when the Queen was at <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> the Chancellor came there, and acquainted Her with the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54967:110"/>Commi≈ø≈øion which the King had given him. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards asked Her ≈øome Que≈øtions, but ≈øo, as to In≈øinuate to Her Maje≈øty, what An≈øwers ≈øhe was to make him. And the Queen pointed with her Finger to the place where ≈øhe u≈øed to keep the Cardinal-Infanta's Letters, and gave him the Keys of it. She told him, That as for what related to the Prince her Brother, ≈øhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øtifle the affection which Nature obliged her to ≈øhow him, but that ≈øhe knew how to love her Brother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing the State; a Maxim directly contrary to that of the Cardinal-Duke, who had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the King, That it was impo≈ø≈øible for him to love His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and his Mother, with his other neare≈øt Relations, at the ≈øame time. The Queen had taken the Precaution to tru≈øt all her Papers with the Marchione≈øs <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> Daughter to the Count <hi>de Carmail;</hi> So that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor found nothing in the Clo≈øet but a few Di≈øciplines.</p>
               <p>From hence he return'd to carry this News to the Cardinal, who was enraged to mi≈øs his Blow, after he had put an Affront of this nature upon the Queen. It fell out very luckily for this Prince≈øs that ≈øhe was big with Child, otherwi≈øe he had too cruelly offended her, not to u≈øe all his Efforts to ruin her; and he had formerly ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the King more than once, to be divorced from her. At the ≈øame time another Accident happen'd at Court, which was not indeed of the ≈øame con≈øequence, but ≈øerves as well to di≈øcover the prodigious Authority of the Mini≈øter. The King had fallen in love with Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moi≈øelle <hi>de la Fayette,</hi> and had for ≈øome time entertain'd a Commerce with her, which was by no means plea≈øing to the Cardinal, who cou'd not endure to ≈øee any one in favour with the King that did not wholly depend upon him. It happen'd without the King's knowing the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of it, that this Lady retired to a Convent call'd <hi>La Vi≈øitation,</hi> to put her ≈øelf in the Service, as ≈øhe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of a greater Lord than he was. The King was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly inqui≈øitive to know the rea≈øon of ≈øo ≈øudden a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; and not contenting him≈øelf with what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Creatures had been in≈øtructed to tell him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to di≈øcover the whole My≈øtery him≈øelf: ≈øo pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hunt in the Fore≈øts which lye between <hi>Gresbois</hi> and this Mona≈øtery, he came to this la≈øt place, where he had
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54967:111"/>a long Conver≈øation with Mademoi≈øelle <hi>de la Fayette:</hi> and thus they came to be ≈øatisfied that they had been both cheated by <hi>Boizenval,</hi> Valet de Chambre to his Maje≈øty, who neverthele≈øs ow'd his preferment to this Lady. Whenever the King ≈øent him to Mademoi≈øelle <hi>de la Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette,</hi> to deliver any Me≈ø≈øage to her, or carry her a Billet, and whenever this Lady ≈øent him back to the King, or writ to him, he went directly to the Cardinal, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the Billets to be chang'd, as he ≈øaw convenient, by counterfeiting the Hand, or el≈øe order'd him what An≈øwers to make. This imperious Mini≈øter had engaged him thus to ≈øacrifice the King and his Benefactre≈øs, by ≈øend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him word, that ≈øince he was made Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre without a Recommendation from him, he mu≈øt not expect to enjoy that Po≈øt long. <hi>Boizenval</hi> affrighted at this Menace, which he did not que≈øtion but the Cardinal wou'd ≈øoon put in execution, went to acquaint him, that if he wou'd be plea≈øed to take him into his Protection, he wou'd blindly obey him in whatever he ≈øhou'd think fit to order. The Cardinal promis'd it, upon condition he wou'd inform him of every thing he ≈øaw: And thus <hi>Boizenval</hi> communicated to him the King's Billets, and tho≈øe of his Mi≈øtre≈øs, which he alter'd in ≈øuch a manner as was mo≈øt proper to in≈øpire them with a di≈øgu≈øt each for the other. At the ≈øame time the Cardinal threaten'd the Marchione≈øs <hi>de Sennecey,</hi> and the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Limoges,</hi> who were related to Mademoi≈øelle <hi>de la Fayette,</hi> to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh them the Court, unle≈øs they prevailed with this Lady to betake her ≈øelf to a Retirement. Their Advice, and the Letters ≈øhe received from the King, obliged her at la≈øt to think of a Reclu≈øe Life; and ≈øhe accordingly put this De≈øign in execution, as it has been already ≈øaid. The King being inform'd that ≈øhe had received ≈øome Billets which were wholly different from tho≈øe which he had writ to her, was ≈øen≈øible that <hi>Boizenval</hi> had betray'd him, and re≈øolv'd to turn him out of his place. While he was in the Parler with Mademoi≈øelle <hi>de la Fayette, Boizenval,</hi> who had follow'd him, was at the Gate, and came to under≈øtand, as ≈øoon as ever the King was gone, that His Maje≈øty and She had been talking of the Cheat he had put upon them. By this be concluded him≈øelf to be undone, and next morning he was di≈øcarded; yet
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54967:111"/>the Cardinal did not conde≈øcend to ≈øpeak one word in favour of him to the King, le≈øt he ≈øhould thereby di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from what Quarter the Cheat proceeded.</p>
               <p>The King had ≈øpent four hours in entertaining him≈øelf with Mademoi≈øelle <hi>de la Fayette;</hi> ≈øo that it being too late for him to go back and lie at <hi>Gresbois,</hi> he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Queen<note n="*" place="margin">The 5th of <hi>September.</hi>

Thus the Cardinal having dictated a Letter, in the King's Name, to <hi>Cher√©</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, his Maje≈øty ≈øigned it.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54967:113"/>Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons,</hi> though ≈øhe cou'd draw nothing but bare Words from them; that the King of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in vain interceded for her, de≈øign'd to ≈øend her el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; that all the≈øe Rea≈øons obliged him to ≈øtick firm to the Propo≈øal he had made to the Queen his Mother that ≈øhe ≈øhou'd retire to <hi>Florence,</hi> where ≈øhe ≈øhould receive what was ≈øufficient to maintain her according to her Quality; that la≈øtly, his Con≈øcience was ≈øatisfied, and that he ≈øhou'd be ju≈øtified before God and before Men, ≈øince he had done all that in him lay, to ≈øatisfie the Queen, without expo≈øing his Kingdom to new Broils and Troubles.</p>
               <p>Upon this An≈øwer, which was wholly founded upon this Suppo≈øition, That the Queen-Mother wou'd embroil the Kingdom, in ca≈øe ≈øhe came back, as if they had been certainly a≈ø≈øur'd of it, and that there was no way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, but by ≈øending her home to <hi>Florence;</hi> the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> touched for her Mothers Affliction, writ ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters to the King and Cardinal with her own Hand, and ≈øent them by my Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> to confirm them by Word of Mouth. The King an≈øwered the≈øe Letters by others, which <hi>Chavigny</hi> compo≈øed and were corrected by the Cardinal, wherein he commends the good intentions of his Si≈øter, but de≈øired her not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øe in this Affair; that he intended on his Side to give his Mother all rea≈øonable Satisfaction, but that ≈øhe had ingag'd her Self in ≈øo many Cabals again≈øt him, that he cou'd come to no other Re≈øolution about her, till a Peace was concluded; that as for the Maintenance they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for her, he was afraid ≈øhe was abu≈øed by her own Evil Councellors, as if there was no Medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween granting her all, and refu≈øing his Mother a Dowry, which lawfully belonged to her, and yet <hi>Lewis the Ju≈øt</hi> refus'd it her.</p>
               <p>Thus my Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi>'s Negotiation came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and though he offer'd in the Name of the King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to ingage for the good Conduct of the Queen-Mother, and promi≈øed every thing which cou'd in rea≈øon be expected, yet they would talk of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing le≈øs than ≈øending this unfortunate Prince≈øs to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> where they promi≈øed to ≈øettle an Appointment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54967:114"/>her, which perhaps they wou'd have ≈øtopt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. No one dur≈øt ≈øpeak a word to the King upon this occa≈øion, and the good Prince could not bethink him≈øelf of any middle Expedient, between treating his Mother with this exce≈ø≈øive Rigour, only to plea≈øe the Cardinal, and re≈øtoring her to her fir≈øt Authority. He cou'd without jealou≈øie, behold his chief Mini≈øter a≈ø≈øume a Power infinitely greater than the Queen-Mother had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to, and abu≈øe it in a more notorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yet it never di≈øturbed him; but the Cardinal had gain'd that ab≈øolute A≈øcendant over him, and had ≈øo far po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed him, that without him, both he and his Kingdom wou'd be intirely ruin'd, and that none but he had hone≈øt intentions towards him, that he perceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Cardinal's De≈øigns.</p>
               <p>However to ≈øecure him≈øelf in ≈øome mea≈øure from the Inhumanity which the World wou'd be apt to charge him with, in refu≈øing to let the Queen-Mother return, ≈øince ≈øhe de≈øir'd it with ≈øo much Submi≈ø≈øion, he wou'd not declare his own Opinion in the Council upon this Affair: But he ingag'd the other Mini≈øters to give their Sentiments in Writing, which he drew up for them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and they afterwards ≈øign'd.

After this, the Dukes and Peers ≈øpoke, and were follow'd by the Chancellour, by the Cardinal, and by the King. At la≈øt the Court ro≈øe, and the King calling the Pre≈øidents to him, told them in a great Pa≈ø≈øion, that they always made it their Bu≈øine≈øs to di≈øobey his Orders, that he was extreamly ill ≈øatisfied with their Conduct, and that he hated all tho≈øe that were again≈øt his Trying a Duke and Peer out of Parliament; that they were ≈øorry, ignorant Wretches, unworthy of Places, and that for all he knew, he might put others in their room; that he was re≈øolv'd to be obey'd, and that he wou'd make them ≈øee, that all their Privileges were only founded upon an illegal U≈øage; and la≈øtly, that he wou'd hear them argue no more about the Matter. Thus the blinde≈øt of all Kings, with whom the Arbitrary Cour≈øes of his Mini≈øter pa≈øs'd for Law and Policy, violated all the Ordinances, as if there had been no ≈øuch thing as Ju≈øtice in <hi>France</hi> before the Cardinal-Duke ≈øate at the Helm, and that all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cu≈øtoms ow'd their Original to Madmen and Fools.

Be≈øides this, in ca≈øe the Dutche≈øs made a Treaty of Neutrality, or a Ce≈ø≈øation of Arms with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to confer with the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> to ≈øee how one might ≈øeize tho≈øe places which lay upon the road from <hi>Pignerol</hi> to <hi>Ca≈øal;</hi> and to effect this de≈øign in ca≈øe it were fea≈øible.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal in the mean time, in all his Letters to the Dutche≈øs, and to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> gave them to under≈øtand, that this Prince≈øs cou'd never truly reckon her≈øelf mi≈øtre≈øs of any place, where ≈øhe had <hi>Piedmonte≈øe</hi> Governours, even tho the Garri≈øon was <hi>French,</hi> becau≈øe tho≈øe Governors wou'd make the people ri≈øe up again≈øt the Garri≈øons. In this conjuncture the Dutche≈øs ≈øent to acquaint Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> that if he did not ≈øurrender the places he had taken, ≈øhe was re≈øolved to throw up all which ≈øhe had into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who already po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed <hi>Carmagnole</hi> and <hi>Quera≈øque,</hi> and who wou'd ≈øoon be ma≈øters of <hi>Turin,</hi> if they had once the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. Soon after ≈øhe began a Treaty with her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-law, by which ≈øhe agreed to divide the Guardian≈øhip with them, and to receive them into <hi>Turin;</hi> which had it gone on, would have infallibly ≈øubjected her to their power, and made her entirely depend upon them. The Amba≈ø≈øadors of <hi>France</hi> took a great deal of pains to make her comprehend, that ≈øhe wou'd ab≈øolutely ruin her≈øelf, if ≈øhe concluded this Treaty; But when they came to talk to her of putting the re≈øt of her Towns into the hands of the King, who was only to keep them for her, till ≈øuch time as ≈øhe cou'd maintain them ≈øafely her≈øelf; then ≈øhe cry'd out, that in≈øtead of a≈ø≈øi≈øting her, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign'd to plunder her of all ≈øhe had, and wou'd not hear them mention the lea≈øt ≈øyllable of it for ≈øeveral days. She was afraid that if the≈øe places were once out of her power and ≈øurrendred to them, they wou'd afterwards pay her ju≈øt ≈øo much re≈øpect as they ≈øhou'd ≈øee convenient, and thus ≈øhe might come to lo≈øe all her authority. But the Mini≈øters of <hi>France</hi> having
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54967:120"/>found means to gain her Councellors over to their party, by pen≈øions which they promis'd them in the Kings name; and in particular, the Cardinal having corrupted the Abbot <hi>de la Monta,</hi> by re≈øigning the Abby of <hi>Nantes</hi> to him; the Dutche≈øs began to ≈øoften a little, and as ≈øhe wanted ready money for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent ≈øupport, there was a nece≈ø≈øity for her at la≈øt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of her ≈øelf to come to the Cardinal's Lure.

               <p>In the mean time the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> died, and the Pope refu≈øed to ≈øay Ma≈øs for his Soul, as 'tis the cu≈øtom, under a pretence that he had header an Army, which was compo≈øed in part of <hi>Lutheran</hi> Troops, again≈øt Catholicks.

But he was repul≈øed with lo≈øs, and the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Cavalry, who came afterwards with full ≈øpeed, were con≈øtrain'd to return to the place from whence they came, without doing any thing.

                  </note> appear'd before the <hi>French</hi> thought he could have reach'd them, ≈øo that <hi>Feuquieres</hi> could not imagine who he was, when he ≈øaw his Colours. As he marched between the Woods, they could not judge what quarter he would attack, and all that the <hi>French</hi> General could do was to put his Army in Battel, in the different po≈øts where they ≈øtood, to be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to march, if there ≈øhould be occa≈øion. All this while <hi>Feuquieres</hi> was in an extraordinary perplexity, which made ≈øeveral Officers laugh who did not love him, and call'd him the <hi>Pedant,</hi> becau≈øe he was fitter
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54967:126"/>for Negotiation, than the Military profe≈ø≈øion. In the mean time <hi>Picolomini</hi> gave the fir≈øt on≈øet on that quarter which was po≈øted on the other ≈øide the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelle,</hi> which he carried after a vigorous oppo≈øition made by the Foot, for the Hor≈øe run away. By this means <hi>Picolomini</hi> threw what ≈øuccors he pleas'd into <hi>Thionville,</hi> and then placed his Army in Battel Array, between the Counter≈øcarp of the place, and the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> without advancing further, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five a clock in the Afternoon. The <hi>French</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who had ≈øent his Artillery Hor≈øes to <hi>Mets,</hi> was of the opinion to ≈øtay for them to carry him off, or at lea≈øt to defer the Retreat till night. But the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having approached a Ravelin, which parted the two Armies, with their Artillery, began to canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade the <hi>French,</hi> who likewi≈øe advanced on their ≈øide; tho for want of Hor≈øes, they were not in a condition to bring up their Artillery. This gave the Enemy an opportunity to pa≈øs the Ravelin, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the re≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>French</hi> Infantry, who were, once more, in this extremity abandon'd by the Hor≈øe. <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> as he perform'd all the Offices of a General, received two ≈øhots from a Mu≈øquet, one of which broke his arm, ≈øo he was obliged to retire the di≈øtance of a Cannon ≈øhot from the place, where the action was.

               <p>The Mare≈øchal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> to whom the Cardinal had given a ≈ømall Army, which he commanded upon the Frontiers of <hi>Champagne,</hi> was blamed for not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to the relief of <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> ≈øince he had notice of <hi>Picolomini</hi>'s March.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54967:131"/>The Queen was exceedingly ≈øurpriz'd at this Order of the King, ≈øince it concern'd a Lady with whom ≈øhe had ≈øo much rea≈øon to be well ≈øatisfied, and cou'd not forbear to ≈øhew a great deal of concern for it: But at la≈øt ≈øhe ≈øaid ≈øhe was born to obey the King, and that ≈øhe would execute his Orders. She perceiv'd well enough from what quarter this ≈øtorm attackt her, and hoping that ≈øhe might perhaps bring the Cardinal to a better temper if ≈øhe addre≈øt her≈øelf to him, ≈øhe writ to him to interpo≈øe in this affair, and prevent the execution of what would give her ≈øo much di≈øturbance. But the Mini≈øter, who was not a man that would ≈øuffer him≈øelf to be wrought upon by pure civilities, ≈øent her word that he was much oblig'd to her Maje≈øty for the confidence ≈øhe ≈øeem'd to repo≈øe in him, but that he could not give her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advice than to obey the King. The Queen was extremely offended at this an≈øwer, and could not forbear to ≈øay, that it was not the King, but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, ≈øhe was forc'd to obey. So without taking the lea≈øt notice of her complaints, or ≈øo much as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting her with it, Madam <hi>de Senecey</hi>'s place was given to Madam <hi>de Bra≈ø≈øac,</hi> whom the Queen could not endure, becau≈øe ≈øhe was entirely in the intere≈øts of the Cardinal. For the ≈øame rea≈øons the Cardinal got the Baron <hi>de St. Ange,</hi> who was Comptroller of the Queens Hou≈øhold, to be di≈øcarded. It ≈øeems he was afraid le≈øt the Queen, who was now become a Mother, might in≈øen≈øibly gain the good affections of the King, and at la≈øt prevail with his Maje≈øty to turn him off. To prevent which, he gave the King to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, that the Queen was exce≈ø≈øively partial to the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria;</hi> and engag'd him as much as he could, to mortifie that Prince≈øs; following his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Maxim, That a man ought not to have any confidence or friend≈øhip for tho≈øe whom<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> he has often treated ill. However, to give the Queen ≈øome time to vent her pa≈ø≈øion, he order'd matters ≈øo, that under a pretence of hunting, the King came not nigh her for a long time.</p>
               <p>A little before this happen'd, the King ≈øeem'd to have an extraordinary kindne≈øs for Madam <hi>de Haute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:54967:132"/>after the retreat of Mademoi≈øelle <hi>de la Fayette;</hi> but the Cardinal did not think it worth his while then to cro≈øs this new amour, becau≈øe ≈øhe was a Lady of a ≈øoft ea≈øie temper, and incapable of caballing. It was ≈øome years ago ≈øince the King had a re≈øpect for her, but he had di≈øcontinued for a long time to give her any marks of it. The Court was mightily ≈øurpriz'd at the Kings fondne≈øs, and knew not well what name to give it, for as on one ≈øide he ≈øeem'd to have a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful pa≈ø≈øion for tho≈øe of the fair Sex, ≈øo he was the colde≈øt of all men living. In≈øtead of ≈øeeking an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to entertain them in private, he never ≈øpoke to them but in the face of the whole Court, and in the Queens Apartment: and this Prince≈øs was ≈øo far from entertaining any jealou≈øie at it, that ≈øhe was extremely pleas'd that the≈øe Ladies drew the King to her Apartment, nay, what is more, ≈øhe made them her friends and confidents. 'Tis probable the King de≈øign'd no more than barely to amu≈øe him≈øelf with their conver≈øation, to unbend him≈øelf from his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affairs. The Cardinal had at fir≈øt without any di≈øtru≈øt beheld the e≈øteem which the King ≈øeem'd to have for Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> but he began to look with an ill eye upon it, when he found this Lady to be an intimate friend of <hi>Mademoi≈øelle de Chemeraut,</hi> who had infinitly more wit than ≈øhe, and was the fitte≈øt per≈øon in the world to ≈øugge≈øt to her, what ≈øhe was to ≈øay to the King.</p>
               <p>To di≈øengage his Maje≈øty from the≈øe corre≈øponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he ≈øu≈øpected, the Cardinal carried him to the frontiers of <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> to efface all the≈øe impre≈ø≈øions. The Duke <hi>de S. Simon,</hi> who had been for ≈øome time a Favorite of the King, being remov'd from him, for ≈øome other rea≈øons, the Cardinal endeavor'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce into his place, <hi>Henri d' Effiat,</hi> Lord of <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,</hi> Son to the Mare≈øchal <hi>d' Effiat,</hi> a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man full of wit, and hand≈øomely made as to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. He was Ma≈øter of the Wardrobe, and after he was in favour, the Duke <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> ≈øurrender'd his place of Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe to him. At fir≈øt the King had an aver≈øion to him, becau≈øe he behav'd
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54967:132"/>him≈øelf very negligently in his Office of Ma≈øter of the Wardrobe, and had inclinations wholly different from tho≈øe of his Maje≈øty. However the Cardinal knew ≈øo well how to manage the King in favour of him, that the antipathy he ≈øeem'd to have for him, turn'd into an extraordinary friend≈øhip and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ≈øo that he could not tarry a day without ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. It was during the Siege of <hi>Hedin,</hi> that the King fir≈øt began to ≈øhew him any marks of his favour; when he gave him a pen≈øion of fifteen hundred Crowns, and ever ≈øince that time, he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him≈øelf without him. And now the King whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgot Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> in who≈øe entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he only ≈øought to meet the ≈øame amu≈øement, as he found in that of his Favourite. After he was in bed, and all the company withdrawn out of the room, he cau≈øed him to ≈øit down by him, and would thus pa≈øs two or three hours alone with him. Thus the Cardinal, by the means of this Favourite, knew all the Kings thoughts, and in the a≈ø≈øurance that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came into his mind, which was di≈øadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Mini≈øtry, he govern'd the State with ea≈øe and tranquillity enough.</p>
               <p>As he had influenced the King to take a fancy to young <hi>d' Effiat,</hi> ≈øo he had al≈øo in≈øtructed the latter how to make him≈øelf be beloved, knowing perfectly what was mo≈øt proper to gain the Kings friend≈øhip. However, le≈øt the ≈øight of Madam <hi>de Hautefort</hi> ≈øhould dimini≈øh this growing favour, the Cardinal ≈øtill found out one way or another to keep the King from <hi>Paris,</hi> as indeed he did the better part of this year. But at la≈øt the Kings Phy≈øicians did in private di≈øapprove of the≈øe long Journeys, and his Maje≈øty expre≈ø≈øing a mighty de≈øire to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> that he might there divert him≈øelf in his Royal Hou≈øes, it was not po≈ø≈øible to detain him from it any longer. So he took the Road to <hi>Paris,</hi> while the Court was in great expectation to ≈øee who would carry it in the Kings favour. The Queen, according to his order, was at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> when he<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</note> arrived thither, and he ≈øaluted her with a coldne≈øs, which might have been expected from him, if he had parted from her
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54967:133"/>but a few hours before. As for Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> who expected to be ≈øo mightily care≈øt by him, he ≈øcarce vouch≈øafed to look at her, and publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øted he would no longer have any con≈øideration for her. Nay, he told her in private, that he knew ≈øhe ≈øpoke ill of <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> but that ≈øhe had better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it, for he had infinitely a greater kindne≈øs for him than ever he had for her, or for any one in the world; and that he would find out a way to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine all tho≈øe that ≈øhould Cabal again≈øt him.</p>
               <p>This was a ≈øufficient indication with a witne≈øs how ≈ømall an e≈øteem the King had for this Lady; however le≈øt his affection ≈øhould break out afre≈øh, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ≈øo order'd matters, that he commanded her, as well as Mademoi≈øelle <hi>de Chemeraut,</hi> to leave the Court. They went both to <hi>Paris,</hi> where they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for ≈øome time in a Mona≈øtery of Nuns; but as they receiv'd too many vi≈øits in that place, the ≈øecond had orders to retire into <hi>Poitou,</hi> and the other to be at lea≈øt forty leagues di≈øtance from <hi>Paris.</hi> The Queen was wonderfully concern'd at their har≈øh u≈øage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øhe had an extraordinary confidence in them, who for their part were thus cruelly treated for no other rea≈øon, but becau≈øe they were not dependents upon the Cardinal. After this manner, all tho≈øe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons were removed from the Queen, in whom ≈øhe could repo≈øe any tru≈øt, le≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhould attempt any thing again≈øt the grandeur of the Mini≈øter; and this new Favourite ≈øerv'd to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the King with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand ≈øtories di≈øadvantageous to that Prince≈øs.</p>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Orders of the Court were preci≈øe, and the Cardinal would never ≈øuffer any difficulties to be ≈øtarted, after he had once projected a thing. Upon this the Council of War re≈øolved to ≈øend him a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the in≈øuperable difficulties that attended this de≈øign, and ≈øo it was laid a≈øide. But ≈øoon after another de≈øign was laid again≈øt <hi>Arras,</hi> a place of far
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54967:134"/>greater importance, where they thought to ≈øucceed much ea≈øier than in the former. The principal diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that offer'd it ≈øelf was, to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from di≈øcovering their de≈øign, and throwing ≈øuccors into the place. For this rea≈øon they came to a re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> ≈øhould march ≈øtrait to <hi>Bethune,</hi> as if he de≈øign'd to be≈øiege that place, and that the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Meilleraye</hi> ≈øhould follow him by ≈ømall Journeys, as it were to ≈øupport him, but that ≈øo ≈øoon as the latter was arrived at <hi>Bapaume,</hi> he ≈øhould turn directly to <hi>Arras,</hi> and the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> ≈øhould do the ≈øame on his ≈øide. This was ≈øo happily executed, that the two Armies appear'd before <hi>Arras</hi> on the 12th of <hi>June,</hi> before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were able to penetrate into their de≈øign. A few days after the Army received the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys and Artillery, for which they had occa≈øion, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not in a condition to hinder it. The <hi>Count d' I≈øemburg,</hi> Governor of the place, who happen'd to be ab≈øent, endeavour'd in vain to get into it, when the Siege was once form'd, and he was obliged to leave the care of his defence to <hi>Eugenius Buel,</hi> an <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Colonel, who commanded in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence. General <hi>Lambos,</hi> who was incamp'd within a league and half of the place, in a very advantageous po≈øt, did likewi≈øe vainly attempt to throw ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief into the Town, being defeated by the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Meilleraye.</hi> In the mean time, notwith≈øtanding the vigorous defence of the Garri≈øon, the place was every day more and more ≈øtrained, ≈øo that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Infanta was forced to march in per≈øon to relieve it, and form'd a Camp at <hi>Mount de S. Eloi,</hi> in a place ea≈øy to be defended, and which was ≈øeparated from the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s quarter by a plain of about a league over. The <hi>French</hi> could not receive their provi≈øions but from a great way off, and part of their Troops mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity leave their Lines to go and meet them. Altho they did not ≈øtand in want of them as yet, yet fearing the Siege would employ them ≈øome time, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them≈øelves with new Troops, the Mare≈øchals pre≈øt the Court to ≈øen them a Convoy without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54967:134"/>lay, and concerted their mea≈øures for this with the Cardinal. The Convoy being ready to depart, the Cardinal gave orders to <hi>Du Hallier</hi> to guard it, but at the ≈øame time the King forbid him to advance, without ≈øaying a word to the Mini≈øter. This Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was founded upon a fear of his Maje≈øty, that in ca≈øe <hi>Du Hallier</hi> and the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> who was to meet him, happen'd to be defeated, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would break into the bowels of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and occa≈øion great di≈øorders there. But than he ran a great hazard too, to leave the Army which be≈øieged <hi>Arras,</hi> in imminent de≈øtruction, to ≈øave the Body which <hi>Du Hallier</hi> commanded. When <hi>Choupes</hi> brought him an order from the Cardinal, he made a thou≈øand difficulties, that he might not march. But at la≈øt, when <hi>Choupes</hi> a≈ø≈øured him that he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to the Cardinal for his conduct, and that he mu≈øt expect to take upon him≈øelf the ill ≈øucce≈øs of the Siege, in ca≈øe it mi≈øcarry'd, <hi>Du Hallier</hi> re≈øolved to obey the Cardinal rather than the King, and ≈øo the Convoy arrived happily to the Camp. This oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Du Hallier,</hi> who had pre≈øum'd for ≈øome time, to ballance the Cardinal's Orders with tho≈øe of the King, was the rea≈øon why he could not obtain a Mare≈øchal's Staff till long after.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having receiv'd advice, that the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> was gone out of the Camp with three thou≈øand Hor≈øe, and three thou≈øand Foot, attacked the <hi>French</hi> Lines, which were double, and forced the fir≈øt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all the re≈øi≈øtance the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> could make. After this they went on to force the ≈øecond, ≈øo that being ≈øupported by a vigorous Sally from the Garri≈øon, they had infallibly reliev'd the place, if the <hi>French</hi> going out of their ≈øecond Line, had not fallen upon them in the Flank, and made them think of a Retreat. In the heat of the Fight the Mare≈øehal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> arrived, and about half an hour after <hi>du Hallier;</hi> ≈øo that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ≈øeeing ≈øo great a number of Troops march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them, were obliged to retire, leaving twelve hundred of their men dead in the <hi>French</hi> Lines.

               <p>All the≈øe di≈øcour≈øes only tended to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves odious to one another, and to lull one another a≈øleep if it were po≈ø≈øible.

               <p>While the <hi>French</hi> were thus negotiating with the Dutche≈øs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> held a clo≈øe corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpondence with the Dutche≈øs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and it was with her con≈øent, that the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the Siege of <hi>Ca≈øal.</hi> He began to inve≈øt this place on the 8th of <hi>April,</hi> with fourteen thou≈øand Foot, and five thou≈øand Hor≈øe, at a juncture when the <hi>French</hi> were ≈øcarce able to defend the Cittadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> again≈øt Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who attack'd it on the ≈øide of the Town.

But the very ≈øame rea≈øons per≈øwaded <hi>Leganez</hi> to undertake this Siege, and pu≈øh it on with all imaginable vigour, becau≈øe it was of the highe≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to <hi>Spain</hi> that the≈øe Princes ≈øhould be ≈øtill dependent upon that Crown, and <hi>Ca≈øal</hi> was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to retain the people of <hi>Piedmont</hi> in their duty.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54967:138"/>for the frequent propo≈øals of Accommodation they made to their Si≈øter-in-law; and was of opinion that the only rea≈øon why they ≈øo much de≈øired to have the Cittadel of <hi>Turin</hi> in their hands, was that they might compound more advantageou≈øly for them≈øelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any con≈øideration to the Intere≈øts of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The≈øe were the motives which engaged <hi>Leganez</hi> to undertake the Siege of <hi>Ca≈øal,</hi> again≈øt the ≈øentiments of the greate≈øt part of the Officers of his Army, who did not look upon him to be ≈øtrong enough for ≈øuch an attempt. He mightily depended upon a ≈øecret intelligence he held in the place, but it fell out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily for him, that <hi>de la Tour</hi> the Governor of that City, di≈øcovered it, and put every thing in ≈øuch good order betimes, that he mu≈øt expect to reduce it no other way but by main force. At the ≈øame time the Governor having given the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> advice of this de≈øign, that General u≈øed all his endeavours to bring his Troops together a≈ø≈øoon as he was able, in order to rai≈øe the Siege, and at the ≈øame time ≈øent word to the Court, that he was re≈øolved to put this enterprize in execution, or el≈øe to dye before the place. He likewi≈øe demanded, that the Troops which were de≈øign'd for <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ≈øhould in≈øtantly advance, and that they would take care to furni≈øh him with all things nece≈ø≈øary for a Campaign. The Cardinal was at a Play when this news came to him, and was ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the boldne≈øs of the undertaking, however he did not think fit to di≈ø≈øwade him from it; on the other hand he told <hi>Correro,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Amba≈ø≈øador who ≈øate near him, that he would not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to give the Count any farther advice about it; that the thing was already done, and that he had great rea≈øon to hope good ≈øucce≈øs from it, by rea≈øon of the good conduct and bravery of the General.

               <p>The Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> having received advice at <hi>Verceil,</hi> whether he retired after his defeat, of the Count's de≈øigns, advanced in hopes to retaliate his late beating, and on the 26th encamped on the other ≈øide the <hi>Po,</hi> upon the Hills near <hi>Quiers,</hi> with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Foot, and four thou≈øand Hor≈øe. After he had at his lei≈øure viewed the <hi>French</hi> Lines, he believ'd it was not po≈ø≈øible to force them, and that it would be better for him to endeavour to cut off their Provi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to oblige them to rai≈øe the Siege for fear of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which he hoped would ≈øoon make their Camp unea≈øy to them. Thus on the 9th of <hi>July</hi> he order'd twelve hundred men to pa≈øs the <hi>Po</hi> near <hi>Montcalier,</hi> where they retrenched them≈øelves to hinder any Victuals from coming to them that way.

This Po≈øt, as it was of the la≈øt con≈øequence to the de≈øign of <hi>Leganez,</hi> he came up thither with his whole Army, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all the efforts of the <hi>French,</hi> yet they were not able to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> quit it.

                  <hi>Leganez</hi> being inform'd of the arrival of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, was afraid they would force their pa≈ø≈øage, and ≈øo render all his labours ineffectual: For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon he re≈øolved to give a general A≈ø≈øault to the <hi>French</hi> Lines, while Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ≈øhould make a vigorous Sally. To effect this, they a≈ø≈øign'd the 11th of <hi>July,</hi> and <hi>Leganez</hi> was to attack the Count's Quarter, while <hi>La Gatta</hi> fell upon that of <hi>La Mothe.</hi> The latter had then four thou≈øand Foot, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand five hundred Hor≈øe; and the Marquis had the ≈øame number of Hor≈øe, and five thou≈øand Foot.</p>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54967:143"/>had it then in his thoughts to de≈øtroy the <hi>Calvini≈øt</hi> Religion entirely, and that he had explain'd him≈øelf upon this Chapter more than once to Chancellor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier.</hi> He propos'd to have a Conference with the Mini≈øters, wherein he hoped to carry them whither he plea≈øed. But le≈øt it ≈øhould have the ≈øame ≈øucce≈øs with the famous Conference of <hi>Poi≈ø≈øy,</hi> he was re≈øolved to ≈øecure him≈øelf before-hand of four≈øcore Mini≈øters, who, joyn'd to tho≈øe that perhaps might ≈øuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to be reduced by his arguments, would bring over, as he imagined, the greate≈øt part of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi> As for the re≈øt, he pretended to employ the Royal Authority, and ≈øo either make Pro≈øelytes of them by dint of ill u≈øage, or if he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe accompli≈øh his end, to turn them out of the Kingdom. He believed that very few Families would rather chu≈øe to abandon their native Country, and ≈øee their admi≈ø≈øion into it for ever lock'd up again≈øt them, than to embrace the Catholick Religion; That it would be a difficult matter for them to re≈øolve to wander like fugitives through the World, to find out a ≈øanctuary to receive them: That they would find in≈øuperable hard≈øhips in ≈øelling off their goods, either becau≈øe there would not be buyers enough to take them off their hands, or becau≈øe they mu≈øt be forced to part with them at too low a price; That altho there might be ≈øome rea≈øon to ≈øu≈øpect the ≈øincerity of the New Converts, yet their Children, ≈øucking the Catholic Religion with their Milk, would be really per≈øwaded of the truth of it. The better to effect this de≈øign, he was of opinion that this A≈ø≈øembly was to be prevail'd upon in the fir≈øt place to declare, that a man might be ≈øaved in both Churches. Becau≈øe if the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were once ≈øatisfied of that, they would ≈øooner chu≈øe to turn Catholics, ≈øo to avoid the mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they were to ≈øuffer, if they ≈øtill continued in their <hi>Calvini≈øm,</hi> than blindly to adhere to the latter, by rejecting a Religion, wherein neverthele≈øs they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that a man might be ≈øaved. After this manner did this Mini≈øter rea≈øon, who imagin'd that other people had no more Religion than him≈øelf. Part of this project has been ≈øince followed in <hi>France,</hi> and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54967:144"/>we find by experience, that contrary to what the Cardinal expected, a prodigious number of Families thought it better to leave the Kingdom than to turn. Tho≈øe per≈øons that have ≈øtudied the≈øe matters a little, know that the generality of mankind are ≈øtrangely wedded to the opinions they learnt in their infancy, e≈øpecially when they appear to be more con≈øonant to rea≈øon, and more agreeable to truth, than the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite doctrines which ≈øome people would have them embrace. But this was the Cardinals blind ≈øide, and his Talent did not lye in the≈øe ≈øort of ≈øpeculations.</p>
               <p>He likewi≈øe fell upon another<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> project, no le≈øs difficult to be effected than the former, and that was to make him≈øelf Patriarch of <hi>France.</hi> He thought him≈øelf already ≈øecur'd of the greate≈øt part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, and to bring the Monks over to his ≈øide he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign'd to be Abbot General of the three mo≈øt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Orders, that ≈øo he might have wherewithal to gain the ≈øuffrages of the Religious. But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> being throughly ≈øatisfied of his ambitious de≈øigns, he could never procure his Bulls, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all his in≈øtances and ≈øollicitations to obtain them; ≈øo that wholly de≈øpairing to compa≈øs his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, this fancy left him, or at lea≈øt he carried it with him to the grave. Thus he never thought any more of this project, for in truth it requir'd another ≈øort of a man than him≈øelf; who, as he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hated, ≈øo he had mo≈øt infallibly peri≈øh'd under the weight of this attempt; which, tho he had been po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the love and e≈øteem of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he would have found a mo≈øt difficult matter to have ever accompli≈øh'd.</p>

                  <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> to deliver it to his Maje≈øty. The King having read the Cardinals Letter, thus directed him≈øelf to the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe, <hi>The Cardinal has here ≈øent me word,</hi> ≈øays he, <hi>that you have te≈øtified a great de≈øire to comply with me in every thing, and yet you don't amend as to one particular,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54967:145"/>which I de≈øired him to re-mind you of, and that is your idlene≈øs.</hi> In≈øtead of promi≈øing the King that he would amend that fault for the future, <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> an≈øwer'd that he could not reform as to that point. Upon this the King replyed, <hi>A man of your condition, who ought to render him≈øelf worthy to command an Army, and who has a≈ø≈øured me that he de≈øign'd ≈øuch a thing, mu≈øt above all things avoid Idlene≈øs, as altogether de≈øtructive to his reputation. Cinq-Mars</hi> bluntly an≈øwer'd, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any preten≈øions that way, and the King main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the contrary; after which he proceeded in his di≈øcour≈øe, telling him that Idlene≈øs made a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of every thing that was commendable; that it was only good for the people of <hi>Mavais,</hi> among whom he was bred up, who entirely abandon'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to their plea≈øures; and that if he de≈øign'd to continue that ≈øort of life, he mu≈øt return to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe replied in a great heat, that he was ready to return thither. <hi>Well,</hi> ≈øays the King, <hi>if I were not wi≈øer than you, I know what an≈øwer I ≈øhould return to what you have ≈øaid.</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> having tho≈øe great obligations to him which he had, ought not to treat him after ≈øuch a fa≈øhion; when the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe, with his u≈øual good addre≈øs and civility an≈øwer'd, that as he was always ready to ≈øerve the King, ≈øo he was as ready to leave him; and that he ≈øhould be full as content to be <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> as <hi>Mon≈øieur le Grand,</hi> and that he could not change his way of living. The King and he continu'd to pique at one another all the way to the Ca≈øtle, till they arriv'd in the very Court, where the King told him, that con≈øidering the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour he was in at pre≈øent, he would mightily oblige him not to come near him. So the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe withdrew, and did not appear before the King for ≈øome days.</p>
               <p>One may ≈øee by this boy≈øterous and in≈øolent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> was not born to continue long in this advantageous Po≈øt to which the Cardinal got him advanced; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. was not a Prince extremely impatient, ≈øince he could ≈øuffer a young fellow to talk to him after ≈øuch a manner. In the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54967:145"/>mean time the<note n="*" place="margin">Aub. ib.</note> Cardinal took care to appea≈øe the Kings anger, at the repeated in≈øtances of <hi>Cinq-Mars;</hi> and the King and his Favourite liv'd together as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. The Mini≈øter was extremely glad to make the Favourite every day more and more dependant upon him≈øelf, in becoming wholly nece≈ø≈øary to him to maintain him in the Kings favour. By this means he continued to know all his Maje≈øty's ≈øecret thoughts, who, re≈øerved and clo≈øe as he was in relation to all others, yet frequently open'd the mo≈øt hidden incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his Soul to his Favourites. Nay, tho he was never ≈øo much minded to conceal what lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, yet his Favourites, by putting him upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øubjects, were able to ≈øound his true ≈øentiments, notwith≈øtanding all the di≈ø≈øimulation he was ma≈øter of; ≈øo that the Cardinal being perfectly inform'd of all occurrences, knew how to regulate his conduct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Altho the King intru≈øted him with the admini≈øtration of all his affairs, yet he was de≈øirous to be made acquainted with every thing, and could not forbear to expre≈øs his di≈øplea≈øure, if he knew that any thing was kept hid from him; or at lea≈øt he ≈øhew'd his di≈ø≈øatisfaction, when he entertain'd him≈øelf in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate with his Favourites; and the Cardinal took care to appea≈øe him by ≈øome flatteries, which he mingled, as he ≈øaw convenient, in his di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer. T. 2. p. 563.</note>
                  <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> being thus reconciled to the King, imagined now that he had nothing more to fear, tho his Maje≈øty expre≈øsly told him, that if the Cardinal once came to be again≈øt him, he would abandom him for ever. The King having taken care that tho≈øe that were about him ≈øhould acquaint the Cardinal with all that he ≈øaid, was ≈øometimes di≈øpleas'd to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf encompa≈øs'd by Spies: but the great occa≈øion he had for his Mini≈øtry, and the high e≈øteem he had for his capacity, hindered him from removing the≈øe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from him, altho he did by no means affect them. However, that he might have one near his per≈øon, to whom he might freely open his ≈øentiments, he made the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe ≈øwear to him, that he would never acquaint the Cardinal with what he ≈øhould tell him. This Mini≈øter was ≈øoon ≈øen≈øible that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54967:146"/>Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe did not come, as he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øtomed, to inform him of what pa≈øt near the King, ≈øo he began at fir≈øt to ≈øu≈øpect him, and at la≈øt form'd a de≈øign to ruine him, on the very fir≈øt occa≈øion that pre≈øented it ≈øelf. The Cardinal's Enemies having ob≈øerved the coldne≈øs between them, did not fail to in≈øinuate into the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter was ill affected to him, and only wanted a fair opportunity to de≈øtroy him. <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> who on his ≈øide did not naturally love his Benefactor, look'd upon his Grandeur as an ob≈øtacle to his own, and did him no more good offices to his Maje≈øty. This Prince being now ≈øatisfied, that <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> carried no more tales to the Cardinal, had a greater affection for him than ever, and re≈øolved to have him admitted into the Privy Council. One day when he was at <hi>Rethel,</hi> the Councellors entred the Council Chamber with the Cardinal, to hold a Council there, and as the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers withdrew to leave them their places, and <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> follow'd them, the King ≈øtopt him, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him≈øelf towards the Cardinal, <hi>That my dear friend here,</hi> ≈øays he, meaning the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe, <hi>may be able to ≈øerve me one day, I think it convenient that he ≈øhould without further delay in≈øtruct him≈øelf in the affairs of my Council.</hi> The Cardinal, who knew well enough that it was to no purpo≈øe for him directly to oppo≈øe the Kings plea≈øure, did not ≈øhow the lea≈øt re≈øentment at that time, and ≈øo held a Council, but took care that nothing of importance ≈øhould be there propo≈øed. But the day following, he repre≈øented to the King, the ill effects ≈øuch an innovation as this might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and the great injury he did his own reputation, as well as that of the Council, if it ≈øhould be ≈øaid that nothing of any con≈øequence could be debated there, unle≈øs ≈øuch a young man as the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe, was one of the number. This remon≈øtrance of the Cardinal made ≈øo deep an impre≈ø≈øion upon the King, that he did not permit <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Council Chamber any more.</p>
               <p>From that time the ≈øecret hatred which the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe bore the Cardinal, broke out in public, and tho≈øe occa≈øions of di≈øcontent which this Mini≈øter
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54967:146"/>lately gave him, wrought a greater force upon the mind of an ambitious young man, than all the ≈øervices he had formerly done him. However, the King labour'd to reconcile them, and outwardly they ≈øeem'd to be as hearty friends as ever. But ≈øoon after they fell out, and the occa≈øion aro≈øe from the Favourite's de≈øiring the King to make him a Duke and a Peer, that he might marry the Prince≈øs <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who would not accept of him but upon that condition. Having open'd this affair to the Cardinal, who he fooli≈øhly imagin'd would comply with his de≈øires, this Mini≈øter tax'd him with imprudence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption, ≈øetting before his eyes what he had done to rai≈øe his Father and him≈øelf from the ≈øimple rank of Gentlemen, to the pre≈øent degree of honour they enjoy'd. <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> who was of no le≈øs haughty a Spirit than the Cardinal, could not hear him talk thus but with the greate≈øt indignation, and began to cabal with all his power, to ruine his Patron and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.

Some weeks after the King a≈ø≈øembled all the ≈øeveral Chambers, and came thither accompanied by the Princes of the Blood, ≈øeveral Dukes and Peers, and many eminent Lords of the Court. He there cau≈øed a Declaration to be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54967:147"/>read, which prohibited the Parliament to concern them≈øelves with any affairs of State, and commanded them to receive his Edicts, not to di≈øapprove, but confirm them. The King farther declared, that he intended to take the ab≈øolute power into his hands of di≈øpo≈øing of all the Offices of Parliament, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with them ≈øuch as plea≈øed him; and at the ≈øame time depo≈øed the Pre≈øident <hi>Barillon,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors <hi>Scarron, Salo,</hi> and ≈øome others that had been bani≈øht before.

This Prince it ≈øeems imagined, that only him≈øelf and his Mini≈øter were intere≈øted in the pre≈øervation of the Kingdom, and thought nothing was ju≈øt, but what this imperious Prelate pretended to be ≈øo.</p>
               <p>Tho≈øe that had the Courage to defend the Rights of Parliament, urged in vain, that the per≈øons that compo≈øed it, had never pretended to be their Kings Tutors, nor to arrogate a power ≈øuperior, or equal to theirs; nor to ≈øet up for <hi>Tribunes of the People,</hi> as their enemies injuriou≈øly accu≈øed them. They own'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to be the Kings Subjects, and to derive their power from his Authority; but then they ≈øaid, that a Secret of Policy lay concealed in the exerci≈øe of their Offices, which the Flatterers at Court were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: That the ancient Kings of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øen≈øible that a pure Monarchy, where all the Laws depend upon the Will of one ≈øingle per≈øon, were but of a ≈øhort continuance, had wi≈øely temper'd the form of Government, by mixing ≈øome appearance of an Ari≈øtocracy with it, and by e≈øtabli≈øhing Laws, which they them≈øelves were not allowed to violate, that ≈øo the People might with greater chearfulne≈øs ≈øubmit to their ≈øoveraign authority: That for this end they had voluntarily ≈øubmitted their own Edicts to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Parliament, that ≈øo they might fully be

               <p>At la≈øt, being entred into <hi>France,</hi> he ≈øaw the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and arrived on the 10th of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> where he was received with all imaginable re≈øpect. A≈ø≈øoon as he appear'd before the King, he immediately ≈øet one Knee upon the ground, and told him, that he came to humble him≈øelf before him, and ≈øubmit his fortune to his Maje≈øty's Clemency. The King offer'd thrice to rai≈øe him up, but he prote≈øted that he would not quit that po≈øture, till his Maje≈øty had forgiven him for all his pa≈øt faults. The King was then plea≈øed to a≈ø≈øure him, that he had not the lea≈øt remembrance of what was pa≈øt, and that he would a≈ø≈øi≈øt him for the future.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> undertook this voyage, to endeavour to regain at lea≈øt one part of his Country, to procure ≈øome money for the ≈øub≈øi≈øtence of his Troops, and to engage the King to act at <hi>Rome</hi> in the favour of his Marriage with the Counte≈øs of <hi>Cante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croix.</hi> If he obtain'd the two fir≈øt Articles, he would be able to make better conditions of agreement with
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54967:149"/>the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> in ca≈øe he de≈øigned to embrace their party afre≈øh, or if he found it advantageous to him, he might ≈øtill continue linked to the Intere≈øts of <hi>France.</hi> But what he mo≈øt earne≈øtly de≈øired was the Confirmation of his Marriage; and he had brought the Counte≈øs along with him into <hi>France,</hi> if the King had not ≈øent him word to leave her at <hi>E≈øpinal.</hi> The Cardinal had given his word to the Nuncio, that he would in no manner ≈øupport the Duke as to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from his Dutche≈øs <hi>Nicole;</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might not ≈øpeak to him about him, he ≈øpread a report abroad, that the King was re≈øolv'd to employ all his power with the Duke to prevail with him to be reconciled to his Wife. When the Duke fir≈øt heard of this pretended de≈øign of the King, he was extremely mortified, for he could not endure to hear the lea≈øt mention of this Accommodation; ≈øo that any one might perceive he took it for a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to talk to him about it, much le≈øs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they would lend him their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to break off his Marriage.

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was no ≈øooner return'd home but he began to fortifie <hi>La Mothe,</hi> an important place, which the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Force</hi> had not been able to take, till after a tedious Siege of ≈øeveral months, as we have already ob≈øerved.

               <p>The ≈øame day that the Garri≈øon of <hi>Aire</hi> marched out, that of <hi>Genap</hi> capitulated, after a Siege of about a months continuance. The King had renewed this year, the antient Treaties he had made with the States General, and had promi≈øed to ≈øend them twelve hundred thou≈øand Livres, upon condition they would attempt ≈øome con≈øiderable enterprize. In pur≈øuance of this Treaty, <hi>Frederic Henry</hi> attacqu'd <hi>Genap,</hi> and after he had made him≈øelf Ma≈øter of the Town, reduced the Ca≈øtle to capitulate at the time abovementioned.</p>
               <p>The taking of <hi>Aire</hi> did ≈øo wonderfully provoke the Cardinal Infanta, by rea≈øon<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of the lamentable con≈øequences this Conque≈øt might draw after it, for the re≈øt of <hi>Artois</hi> and for <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he re≈øolv'd to di≈ølodge the Army of the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Meille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raye,</hi> and attempt the Siege of this place,<note n="*" place="margin">Siri lb. p 465.</note> before they could furni≈øh it with nece≈ø≈øary provi≈øions. So <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boi</hi> having join'd him with four thou≈øand Foot, and two thou≈øand Hor≈øe, the day after the reduction of the place, he adventur'd to be≈øiege the victorious Army, and to hinder them from receiving victuals or other relief, he made a Detachment out of his Army, under the command of the Count <hi>de Sala≈øar,</hi> who took <hi>Lillers,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Eclu≈øe</hi> between <hi>Doway</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> and defeated a Convoy which advanced to throw them≈øelves into this latter Fort. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made ≈øome new Forts between <hi>Terwen</hi> and <hi>St. Omers,</hi> to hinder any provi≈øions from coming that way.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of <hi>Angu≈øt</hi> the Cardinal Infanta marched directly towards the Lines of the <hi>French,</hi> whom he kept in breath with continual skirmi≈øhes, but was not able to bring them to a battel, till at la≈øt the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> fearing that if he ≈øtay'd in

Before he parted, he repair'd the Breaches as well as he could, and fill'd up the greate≈øt part of the Lines. He put three thou≈øand men into the place, and gave the Government of it to <hi>Aigueberre,</hi> with food enough for two or three months, if rightly managed. He could not leave them any more Powder, which was ab≈øolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for them, but he hoped to throw a Convoy ≈øhortly into the place.</p>
               <p>A≈ø≈øoon as the Mare≈øchal was di≈ølodged, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Infanta enter'd his Lines, and began the Siege of this place, with a great deal of vigour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but ≈øo as not to expo≈øe his men too much to the Enemy's ≈øhot. As he knew it was not provided with every thing nece≈ø≈øary, he hoped ≈øoon to reduce the Garri≈øon by Famine. The Mare≈øchal did what he could to throw ≈øome provi≈øions into it, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ≈øo ≈øtrongly upon their guard, that all tho≈øe that endeavor'd it were beaten back with lo≈øs. By the 20th of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rais'd three Batteries, the be≈øieged not thinking it worth the while to incommode them by their Cannon, becau≈øe they had not Powder enough, and were oblig'd to re≈øerve the little they had till a time of nece≈ø≈øity. Soon after the Garri≈øon di≈øarm'd the Burghers, and turn'd all unpro≈øitable Mouths out of the place. However, to oblige the Cardinal Infanta to abandon his de≈øign, the Mare≈øchal <hi>de Breze</hi> attacked <hi>Lens,</hi> which he took, and <hi>Meilleraye</hi> took <hi>la Ba≈ø≈øee</hi> likewi≈øe, and made inroads into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they burnt and ravaged ten or twelve leagues round the Country.

               <p>On the 26th of <hi>January</hi> the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Army advanced to attack <hi>Montjui,</hi> which is within half a league of <hi>Barcelona;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Catalonian</hi> Cavalry, to the number of five hundred, marched out of the City to ob≈øerve the Countenance of the Enemy. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> perceiving it, privately retired into a Wood of Olive Trees, to cut off the≈øe Hor≈øe, and at the ≈øame time attack'd them in the Front, to amu≈øe them. <hi>Bezancon</hi> and <hi>Serignan</hi> ea≈øily ≈øu≈øtain'd the ≈øhock of the latter, but ≈øoon after the Duke <hi>de St. George,</hi> at the head of the others, came out from behind the Wood, and marched towards them. Altho the Cannon of the City began to incommode them, yet they ≈øtill advanced forward, even within Mu≈øquet ≈øhot, and bravely attack'd the <hi>French</hi> Cavalry with Swords in their hands; but the Duke being mortally wounded, and ≈øeveral Officers of Note killed, tho≈øe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him were obliged to retreat, leaving a hundred and fifty dead upon the ≈øpot, and a great number of wounded.

               <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after the defeat of <hi>Montjui,</hi> retreated to their fir≈øt Camp of <hi>Tarragone,</hi> and the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> encouraged by this Victory, put them≈øelves in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øture to pre≈øerve the advantage they had gain'd.

               <p>Not long after, the Cardinal ≈øaid publickly, that the King had certain proofs that the Princes had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Treaty with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the means of the Abbot <hi>de Mercy,</hi> and la≈øtly by Don <hi>Michael de Salamanca,</hi> Secretary to the Cardinal Infanta, with whom the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had per≈øonally conferr'd near <hi>Sedan.</hi> The Counte≈øs of <hi>Soi≈ø≈øons</hi> being inform'd of what the Mini≈øter had thus affirm'd, went to ≈øee him with the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> to endeavour to ju≈øtifie her Son, and to obtain for him a prolongation of the permi≈ø≈øion he had to re≈øide at <hi>Sedan.</hi> The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal return'd no po≈øitive an≈øwer to the Counte≈øs's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, under a pretence of con≈øulting his Maje≈øty before-hand, but ≈øome days after, ≈øending for the Duke and Dutche≈øs, he told them, <q>That the King and he were willing to believe that the Count was not guilty, altho they knew that the Duke of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> had treated with Don <hi>Michael de Salamanca,</hi> upon the frontiers of the Principality of <hi>Sedan;</hi> and that it was hardly to be imagined that the Count, who had ≈øo particular a friend≈øhip for the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> knew nothing of the matter: That if it were true, that he was wholly ignorant of it, he ought to leave <hi>Sedan,</hi> and di≈øengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf from the Duke's Intere≈øts: That he might go to <hi>Venice</hi> or to <hi>Neufchatel,</hi> or to any of his Country hou≈øes: That it was extremely ≈øcandalous for a Prince of his Birth, to live united with the enemies of the Kingdom, where his de≈øcendants might one day ≈øit upon the Throne; that, in fine, it was not ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him to be innocent, but that he ought to be exempt from all ≈øu≈øpicion.

               <p>Some of the Count's friends advi≈øed him to retire from <hi>Sedan,</hi> and give way to the Mini≈øters indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would otherwi≈øe de≈øtroy him; but he could not endure to hear any talk of it, and continued firm in his re≈øolution to run the ≈øame fortune with the Dukes of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Gui≈øe.</hi> As none of the≈øe three were in the humour to rely upon the Cardinals good nature, they at la≈øt concluded their Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> to furni≈øh them with ≈øufficient Forces.

                  </gap>tackt, it was to be feared, that as ≈øoon as the≈øe Princes had an Army, they would make excur≈øions into the heart of the Kingdom. In ca≈øe they gain'd any advantages at fir≈øt, it was rea≈øonable to apprehend that va≈øt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people would flock to them, and ≈øo their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty become very formidable.</p>
               <p>The≈øe con≈øiderations made the Cardinal appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely irre≈øolute and full of di≈øtru≈øt. Sometimes he talked of giving no quarter to the Kings Enemies, but entirely de≈øtroying them; at other times he ≈øeem'd not unwilling to enter into ≈øome compo≈øition, and ≈øeem'd to repent that he had provok'd ≈øo many people to de≈øpair, who were really in a better ca≈øe to make them≈øelves be fear'd, than he at fir≈øt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. Thus when the Amba≈ø≈øador of the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ≈øpoke to the Cardinal of the Mediation of his Ma≈øters to accommodate this affair, by rea≈øon of the intere≈øt which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had in the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s pre≈øervation, he was at fir≈øt li≈øtned to by the Mini≈øter with great attention.</p>
               <p>Another thing happen'd at this time, which gave him a great deal of di≈øturbance. He learnt of the King, that <hi>Bullion,</hi> the Superintendant of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, had told him that all the Money for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and the Artillery was ≈øpent: (The Cardinal was Intendant of the Marine, and his Cou≈øin, the Mare≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> Grand Ma≈øter of the Artillery) That the Cardinal was the Author of this War, and only kept it up for his private ends: That he knew
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54967:164"/>not where to find any more Money to ≈øupport it; but that if he would be plea≈øed to grant a few years Peace to his Kingdom, he would take care to lay up ≈øuch con≈øiderable ≈øumms, that they ≈øhould be ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to carry on any de≈øign whatever, in which his Maje≈øty had a mind to engage him≈øelf. At la≈øt, <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> begg'd of his Maje≈øty not to ≈øpeak a ≈øyllable of this to his Eminence, becau≈øe if he came to know of it, he would never ≈øuffer him to dye in his Bed. The King gave him his promi≈øe, and believing what he told him was true, kept his word with him, and ≈øaid nothing of it to the Cardinal till the Superintendant was dead.

But the Enemies having pa≈ø≈øed the River, within a quarter of a league of his Camp, before the Mare≈øchal's Guards perceiv'd it; as he marched the next day towards the River, expecting the Enemy might attempt to pa≈øs it, he found to his ≈øurpize that their Army marched towards him, near the Wood of <hi>Marfee.</hi> He immediately put him≈øelf in Battel array in very good order, while the Enemy did the ≈øame, in a place too narrow, and much le≈øs advantageous, ≈øo that in all probability they would be beaten. The Mare≈øchal's Right Wing began the Battel with ≈øome advantage, but the Cavalry of the Left Wing, po≈ø≈øe≈øt by I know not what ≈øort of a pannic fear, turn'd back upon their own Foot, whom they put into di≈øorder; ≈øo that the Royal Infantry being attackt by the Princes, was broken after ≈øome re≈øi≈øtance, and fled with the Hor≈øe, which it was impo≈ø≈øible to per≈øwade to rally again. This movement carried away the Right Wing, and the Mare≈øchal was oblig'd to retreat as the re≈øt had done. Whil≈øt the other part of the Army fled in this manner, the Regiment of <hi>Rou≈øillon,</hi> and two Companies of Hor≈øe of the Queen Mother, with that of Mon≈øieur, who were in a manner the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Troops that did any ≈øervice, pierced to the very place where the Count <hi>de Soi≈ø≈øons</hi> was.

Some ≈øay it

The Queen broke this de≈øign which the King had form'd to carry her with him, by telling him all in tears, that ≈øhe could never endure to be ≈øeparated from her Children; and, as it was not thought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øable to expo≈øe them to ≈øo tedious a Journey, the King gave her leave to ≈øtay with him at <hi>St. Germains.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was left at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Title of Regent, during his Maje≈øty's ab≈øence, and two hundred men a≈ø≈øign'd him for his Guard.</p>

In the Camp at <hi>Perpignan</hi> the whole Army was divided into two Factions, one of them named <hi>Royali≈øts,</hi> the other <hi>Cardinali≈øts,</hi> but it ≈øeems the brave≈øt men in the Army declared for the former.</p>
               <p>The King being in the Army fell dangerou≈øly ill there, but his illne≈øs did not la≈øt long. In the mean time, the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe a≈ø≈øured him≈øelf of the Guards and <hi>Swi≈ø≈øes,</hi> and made the Officers promi≈øe to ≈øerve the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in the di≈øpute that would ari≈øe between him and the Cardinal, concerning the Megence. The Mare≈øchals <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> and <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> were Heads of the contrary party; but if the King had died, in all probability they would have tack'd about. In the mean time, the favour of the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe daily dimini≈øhed, and now there remain'd little more than a feeble appearance of it, which he pre≈øerved as long as he was able: The King had no more any of tho≈øe long Conferences which he u≈øed to have with him when he was in Bed. This
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54967:177"/>great alteration occa≈øioned <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> to pre≈øs Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur ince≈ø≈øantly to retire to <hi>Sedan,</hi> while the King importun'd him to come to <hi>Perpignan.</hi> But the Duke neither moved for the one nor the other: He did not obey the King, under pretence of his Gout, for which rea≈øon he was advi≈øed to go to the Waters of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> and he did not go to <hi>Sedan,</hi> becau≈øe he could not do it without an order in writing from the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> to the Governor of that place, which he had forgot to ask him for, before he pa≈øt the Mountains. He was therefore obliged to ≈øend for it, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øted <hi>Montmor</hi> with this Commi≈ø≈øion, to whom the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> refu≈øed to give the order he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, becau≈øe he did not know him. So after him was ≈øent the Count <hi>d' Aubijouv,</hi> one of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur's Dome≈øtics, who departed in the habit of a Capuchin.</p>
               <p>In this interim, the Cardinal being ≈øtill ≈øick at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and the King before <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter received advice from <hi>Spain,</hi> that a certain <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was ≈øeen in the Count-Duke's Anti-chamber; and it was every where di≈øcour≈øed, that the Cardinal's enemies had made a Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> but at that time the Mini≈øter was not able to procure a Copy of the Treaty. This kept him in a perpetual inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and he de≈øir'd the King to come to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> under a pretence of entertaining him about ≈øome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the greate≈øt con≈øequence. But he de≈øir'd it to no purpo≈øe, the King being ob≈øtinately re≈øolved not to quit the Blockade of <hi>Perpignan.</hi> The Cardinal likewi≈øe ob≈øerved, that the King enquired very neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently after his health, which made him apprehend, that his Enemies had gain'd an entire a≈øcendant over the King's inclinations. He did not imagine him≈øelf ≈øafe at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> ≈øo pretending that the Air of that City did not agree with him, and that his Phy≈øitians advi≈øed to go to the Waters of <hi>Tare≈øcon,</hi> he departed from thence, and when he took any road he cau≈øed a report to be ≈øpread before, that he went another way; he often changed the road, and embarked at <hi>Ayde</hi> to go part of the way by water, that ≈øo in ca≈øe of nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity he might retire into <hi>Italy.</hi> Nay, 'tis ≈øaid that he

               <p>Thus while Mon≈øieur and the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe were deliberating upon what they had to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming to any re≈øolution, the Cardinal receiv'd a Pacquet, wherein he found a Copy of the Treaty of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi> Some people ≈øay it was the Nuncio in <hi>Spain</hi> that ≈øent it to him: Others name other per≈øons. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ≈øo unwi≈øe as to let a Copy be taken of it, they committed an unpardonable Soleci≈øm; and if this Copy came from the Con≈øpirators, the fault was ≈øtill the greater. However it came about, the Cardinal no ≈øooner procured it, but he ≈øent <hi>Chavigny</hi> to the King to ≈øhow it him, and to de≈øire him to cau≈øe <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> to be apprehended. <hi>Chavigny</hi> had all the trouble in the world to make his Maje≈øty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolve to deliver this Criminal into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice. He fell down upon his knees, and pray'd to God to in≈øpire him with the be≈øt re≈øolution, and ≈øent for F. <hi>Sirmond</hi> a Je≈øuite, and his Confe≈ø≈øor, to ask his advice. The Father Confe≈ø≈øor was not backward to tell him, that after ≈øo enormous a crime as this was, the King need not ≈øcruple to order his Favourite to be apprehended. According to the cu≈øtom of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, to apprehend any one for a crime again≈øt the State, and to put him to death, was in a manner the ≈øame thing; as if it had been unlawful, once in his life, to have ≈øhown mercy to ≈øome of the Cardinals Enemies.</p>
               <p>As it was a nice and difficult matter to apprehend the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe in the Army, where he was extremely beloved, the King was re≈øolved to go to

               <p>While this Proce≈øs was preparing, the Cardinal, who continued ≈øtill at <hi>Tara≈øcon,</hi> received advice that the Q. Mother, his ancient Benefactre≈øs, and for ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years one of the principal objects of his hatred, died at <hi>Colen</hi> on the third of <hi>July.</hi> He cau≈øed a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ≈øervice to be celebrated for her in the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giat Church, as if he de≈øign'd to make her ≈øome repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after her death, for all the evil he had done her while ≈øhe was alive. 'Tis ≈øaid his Maje≈øty was
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54967:180"/>extremely grieved at this News, and that his natural affection began but too late to revive, when he came to con≈øider that through his onw want of tenderne≈øs, and to ≈øatisfy a rigorous inflexible Mini≈øter he had ≈øuffer'd his Mother to dye in bani≈øhment and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and never would hearken to a reconciliation with her, altho ≈øhe ≈øo earne≈øtly de≈øired it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal ≈øtill tarried at <hi>Tara≈øcon,</hi> when finding him≈øelf ≈øomewhat better, he began to think of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Paris.</hi> As he was not entirely re≈øtored to his health, and apprehended le≈øt he ≈øhould renew his di≈øtemper by being jolted in a Coach, he cau≈øed a ≈øort of a Litter to be contrived wherein was his Bed, with a little Table and a Chair for one per≈øon to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe and confer with him. It was cover'd with Damask, with a Wax covering over that, to ≈øerve in time of rain. This Litter was to be carried by eighteen men, and the Cardinal had re≈øolved to choo≈øe Pea≈øants for that Employment, but his Guards offer'd their ≈øervice to him, and relieved one another by turns, as heretofore <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Souldiers did upon a like occa≈øion. When they were upon this duty, tho≈øe that carried the Litter walked with their heads uncovered. As this Litter was too large to enter the Gates of ≈øome Towns, they were forced to beat down the walls of all tho≈øe places through which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was minded to pa≈øs, as well as the walls of the Hou≈øes where he lodged, and brought his portable Chamber. Nay, the Roads mu≈øt be enlarged when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they happen'd to be too narrow, and levelled where they were too uneven. Thus our ambitious Mini≈øter travell'd about two hundred Leagues in this Triumphant Bed, and if I may be allowed the expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, enter'd every where through a breach, after he had equally ruin'd his private enemies, and de≈øtroy'd all the priviledges of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>To return to the Con≈øpirators, <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> having been<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer. T. 2. l. 3. p. 1182, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

He ≈øhowed the ≈øame con≈øtancy when he was confronted with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> tho he was extremely ≈øurprized at it. What perplexed the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54967:181"/>Judges upon this occa≈øion, was that having only one Copy of the Treaty, it was a difficult matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe without his confe≈ø≈øion. They u≈øed all imaginable means to extort the truth out of <hi>de Thou,</hi> whom both Mon≈øieur and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> affirmed to know the whole affair, except only the League with <hi>Spain,</hi> but he prote≈øted that he knew nothing of what they asked him, and that the only rea≈øon why he had endeavoured to cement a friend≈øhip between the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> was upon ≈øome particular con≈øiderations which were not in the lea≈øt criminal. It was di≈øcour≈øed, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was to confront the Pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but he ≈øo earne≈øtly begged of the King to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt him from it, and ≈øo po≈øitively declared that he would rather fly to the end of the world, than be brought to ≈øo ≈øcandalous a pa≈øs, that contrary to all equity and ju≈øtice, his bare te≈øtimony was to go for valid without any per≈øonal appearance, provided he would an≈øwer to the interrogatories of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in the pre≈øence of ≈øeven Commi≈ø≈øioners. In the mean time <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> having declared he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs all, if they would promi≈øe him his life, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ≈øent <hi>Laubardemont</hi> the Regi≈øter of this Tryal to him, who promi≈øed it him upon condition, he would ≈øpeak the truth again≈øt <hi>De Thou,</hi> who had, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, depo≈øed again≈øt him. He fell into this Snare, and being interrogated on the 12th of <hi>September</hi> by the Chancellor and the other Commi≈ø≈øioners, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed all, and as for what related to <hi>De Thou,</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed that the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> had been communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by <hi>Fontrailles</hi> at <hi>Carca≈ø≈øonne,</hi> but that he prote≈øted again≈øt this de≈øign, and heartily-condemn'd it: Nay, that he had ≈øaid more than once, that if he were not afraid of the great credit of the Criminals, he would go to di≈øcover all to the King, and that he had endeavour'd to di≈ø≈øwade the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> from this attempt, which he thought would mi≈øcarry for ≈øeveral rea≈øons. Not long after, <hi>De Thou</hi> was brought to his examination, who at fir≈øt denied all, but being confronted by <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> confe≈ø≈øed all, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he added, that he had done all that lay in his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54967:181"/>power to make the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe quit this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; that he had frequently quarrelled with him for coming to the≈øe extremities, without con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what might be the con≈øequence of them; and la≈øtly, that being but very imperfectly in≈øtructed in this affair, and having no proofs of it in his hands, to convince the Criminals before the King, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not look upon him≈øelf obliged to reveal all he knew of the matter, e≈øpecially ≈øince the Con≈øpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were not in a condition to make it ≈øucceed. <hi>De Thou</hi> thought it the be≈øt way to confe≈øs all, without ≈øuffering him≈øelf to be farther pre≈øt, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the Rack, which he extremely dreaded, but could have avoided it by no means, if he had continued to deny the fact.</p>
               <p>The Kings Attorney General was of opinion, that both of them ought to ≈øuffer for their crime. All the Judges agreed that the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe ought to dye, for making a Treaty with the Enemies of the Crown. <hi>De Thou</hi> was likewi≈øe found guilty of High Trea≈øon, becau≈øe he did not di≈øcover this Treaty as ≈øoon as he was made acquainted with it; and for ≈øome violent pre≈øumptions that he had made it his bu≈øine≈øs to engage the Con≈øpirators in this union, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the welfare of the State. There were only two of the Judges that voted again≈øt their being put to death; but <hi>Laubardemont</hi> urged an Edict of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. upon this occa≈øion, by which tho≈øe that knew of any de≈øign levell'd again≈øt the Government, and don't reveal it, are declared to be guilty of High Trea≈øon. Thus they were condemned to have their Heads ≈øtruck off in the Market place at <hi>Terreaux,</hi> and the<note n="*" place="margin">See their Trial in the 2d Tome of the <hi>Merc.</hi> of <hi>Siri l. 3.</hi> and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Death.</note> ≈øame day Sentence was executed; le≈øt the King, who had a great kindne≈øs for the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe, and might be induced to have ≈øome compa≈ø≈øion for <hi>De Thou,</hi> who was no farther a Criminal than as he had declined to accu≈øe his Friend, ≈øhould pardon them. The Cardinal ≈øtill kept to his beloved Maxim, never to de≈øtroy and one by halves, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Clemency of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. by a ≈øpeedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. After all, there is no que≈øtion to be made, but that the Accu≈øed were really guilty of de≈øigning
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54967:182"/>to get the management of affairs into their own hands without the Kings con≈øent; and if they had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhed their intentions, the people had not been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than they were under the Cardinal, and in all probability the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> had only become more formidable by it. Neither the King, nor they, according to the common opinion, were in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ≈øu≈øtain the weight of affairs with ≈øuch a re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and conduct, as the Cardinal had all along ≈øhown. They were influenced by a principle of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and envy, and did not act for the real good of the people; and it was better for <hi>France,</hi> that an Ambition, ≈øupported by ≈øo little Conduct, ≈øhould prove fatal to the accu≈øed, than to behold the greate≈øt Mini≈øter ≈øhe ever had, peri≈øh by their intrigues; and the King made a Slave to ≈øome per≈øons, who were more unfit to govern than him≈øelf. However, if the King had had the Courage to have pardon'd <hi>De Thou,</hi> who was the lea≈øt guilty among them, he had won the applau≈øes of the whole Kingdom, and had not in the lea≈øt ≈øinned again≈øt the rules of good policy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chavignac,</hi> a <hi>Hugonot</hi> Gentleman, who had ≈øerved under the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and whom the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe had got to be recalled to the Court, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him in his de≈øigns, was freed and acquitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he refu≈øed to be concerned in this matter, altho he openly profe≈øt him≈øelf to be an humble ≈øervant of <hi>Cinq-Mars.</hi> 'Tis certain his innocence appeared ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, ≈øince he ≈øo fortunately e≈øcap'd tho≈øe Judges, who, as the world reported of them, were ready to find all people guilty, that the Cardinal had a mind to de≈øtroy.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was accu≈øed for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a vi≈øit from <hi>De Thou;</hi> who would have fain per≈øwaded him to embark in this affair; and the Cardinal, who de≈øired to di≈øcover all the Accomplices, ≈øent for him to Court, and got the King to write to him upon that ≈øcore. The Duke made an≈øwer that he knew nothing of the matter; but altho his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty writ to him thrice to come to him, he judg'd it more advi≈øable to pretend an indi≈øpo≈øition, and at la≈øt withdrew into <hi>England.</hi>

               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:54967:182"/>
               <p>As for what concerned the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the King pardon'd him, upon condition he would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the City and Ca≈øtle of <hi>Sedan,</hi> to be annexed to the Crown, without in≈øi≈øting on any other terms but his Life and Liberty; and that he ≈øhould intirely tru≈øt the Kings genero≈øity, as for what he might be plea≈øed to give him by way of exchange.<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer.

As ≈øoon as he was ≈øet at liberty, he took po≈øt to <hi>Montargis,</hi> where the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal then was, to whom he made a vi≈øit; after which, without ≈øeeing the King, he retir'd into <hi>Champagne,</hi> to the Count <hi>de Rou≈ø≈øi,</hi> his Brother-in-law, where the Dutche≈øs of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was; and from thence to a Ca≈øtle which he had in <hi>Perigord.</hi> This Prince was generally condoled for the lo≈øs he ≈øu≈øtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but every body was ≈øurpriz'd, that he ≈øhould ≈øo ea≈øily be drawn into this de≈øign, immediately after he had fortunately got out of another.</p>
               <p>Thus the Cardinal defeated this Con≈øpiracy, with great glory to him≈øelf, and very advantageou≈øly for the Intere≈øt of <hi>France.</hi> Altho tho≈øe that envied his authority were not, properly ≈øpeaking, enemies of the State, yet as they could not de≈øtroy this Mini≈øter but by embroiling the Kingdom, by the help of its real enemies, they furni≈øhed the other party with a plau≈øible pretence to accu≈øe them with de≈øigning to betray their King and Country. The Cardinal recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the news of the death of <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> and <hi>De Thou,</hi> almo≈øt at the ≈øame time that advice was ≈øent him of the reduction of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> writ a Letter to the King, which began after this manner: <hi>Sir, your arms are in</hi> Perpignan, <hi>and your Enemies are dead.</hi> In the compa≈øs of one month, <hi>France</hi> got po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of two Places, that were of the la≈øt importance to her, particularly ≈øo long as ≈øhe was engaged in a War with <hi>Spain. Perpignan</hi> ≈øecured <hi>Rou≈øillon,</hi> and put her in a condition to pre≈øerve <hi>Catalonia,</hi> in ca≈øe ≈øhe per≈øi≈øted in that re≈øolution, and <hi>Sedan</hi> hindred the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from entring <hi>France</hi> on that ≈øide, whereas before if
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54967:183"/>they gain'd the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> over to their party, which was no difficult matter, they might ea≈øily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, when ever they plea≈øed. On the other hand the affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> went every day wor≈øe and wor≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> IV. having been proclaimed King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> not only re≈øolved to pre≈øerve the Crown, which was ≈øo lately put upon his head, but likewi≈øe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain all that it formerly po≈ø≈øe≈øt in <hi>Afric, America,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Government of the <hi>Ca≈øtilians</hi> was become ≈øo odious every where, where the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugue≈øes</hi> had formerly been, that this de≈øign ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no le≈øs happily, at a great di≈øtance from <hi>Spain</hi> that it had about the <hi>Tagus.</hi> The <hi>Portugue≈øes</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extraordinary Joy the News of the re-e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment of the Flou≈øe of <hi>Braganze,</hi> to which they generally ≈øubmitted in ≈øpight of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In the mean time, the new King finding that the <hi>Ca≈øtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were unable to pre≈øerve their u≈øurpations, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beat them out of the ancient bounds of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but likewi≈øe enter'd into the dominions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, and advanced as far as <hi>Salamanca.</hi> He be≈øieged ≈øeveral Towns in <hi>Gallicia, E≈øtramadura,</hi> and <hi>Andalu≈øia,</hi> nay he had certainly made the≈øe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the Theatre of the War, by cau≈øing his Army to ≈øub≈øi≈øt there, if there had been any ≈øtrong places, or ≈øuch as were in a condition to be fortified, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Spain</hi> was reduced to an extreme weakne≈øs thro the great indi≈øcretion of the Count-Duke, and the di≈øcontents of ≈øome Princes, and ≈øeveral great Lords. The Kingdoms of <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> that po≈ø≈øe≈øt great privileges, could not without a ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible regret ≈øee them daily infringed. <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which had ≈øo lately call'd in the <hi>French</hi> for that very rea≈øon, furni≈øhed them with a very bad example, and might perhaps influence them to do ≈øomething of the like nature, if things were not regulated in good time. The Intrigues of the Duke <hi>de Medina Sidonia,</hi> and of the Marquis <hi>d' Alamont</hi> put <hi>Andalu≈øia</hi> into a tottering condition; which Province was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides incen≈øed at the change which had lately been made in the Money, which after it had been made to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54967:183"/>go at an exce≈ø≈øive high rate, was at la≈øt cried down. Tho≈øe of <hi>Bi≈øcay</hi> had a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øinated a Farmer who had been ≈øent thither to introduce marked Paper again≈øt the Franchi≈øes of that Country, and were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd at the puni≈øhment of the principal Male-contents, who had been wheedled to <hi>Madrid</hi> by the Count-Duke under a promi≈øe of being pardoned there, and altho this had happen'd many years before, yet they ≈øtill deeply re≈øented that perfidious u≈øage. In ≈øhort, the exce≈ø≈øive poverty of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides was inviron'd almo≈øt on all ≈øides by <hi>Portugal,</hi> made it incapable to contribute much to the expence of the War. Add to this, that the Catholick King had ≈øu≈øtain'd great lo≈ø≈øes in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any advances there, thro the ill conduct of his Generals, and that his <hi>America</hi> Fleet was de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ≈øo that he was forced to borrow Silver Plate of private per≈øons, to Coin it into Money.

               <p>In the mean time he cau≈øed forces to march from all parts, at an incredible expence, to endeavour the relief of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and 'tis very ob≈øervable, that in ≈øix months time, after he had u≈øed his greate≈øt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, he could bring no more than thirty thou≈øand men into the field. To compleat his misfortunes, they arrived too late; for the place which had long ≈øuffer'd the utmo≈øt extremities of Famine, and which no one took any care to relieve, was obliged to ≈øurrender, on the 7th of <hi>September, Don Flores d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vela</hi> delivered it up to the Mare≈øchal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> wholly de≈øtitute of Victuals, but extremely well ≈øtored with Ammunition: It had an Ar≈øenal ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to arm twenty thou≈øand Foot and Hor≈øe, ≈øix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcore pieces of Cannon, and three thou≈øand pounds of Powder, with all other things nece≈ø≈øary for its defence.

               <p>This Conque≈øt gave no little joy to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> by rea≈øon of the mighty importance of the place, which covered their Frontiers on that ≈øide, and made them Ma≈øters of <hi>Rou≈øillon.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was exceedingly concern'd at it, and could not di≈ø≈øemble his re≈øentments, while the Count-Duke affected a certain Gayety, which ≈øurprized all the World.

The <hi>Barberines</hi> being in a great fright, had recour≈øe to the Mini≈øters of <hi>France,</hi> and de≈øired them to interpo≈øe the authority of the King, to bring this affair to ≈øome accommodation: Altho they were not ≈øorry in <hi>France</hi> to ≈øee the≈øe di≈øorders and broils in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet they were afraid le≈øt the Confederate Princes, ≈øeeing the happy ≈øucce≈øs of the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s enterprize, might form ≈øome de≈øigns di≈øadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the re≈øt of <hi>Italy.</hi> For this rea≈øon they were glad of any opportunity to ≈øtop the progre≈øs of the League, and they did it effectually, by beginning to negotiate afre≈øh. The Mini≈øters of ≈øeveral Princes, and tho≈øe of the Pope, met at <hi>Ca≈øtel Georgio</hi> for this purpo≈øe; but after abundance of propo≈øals on both ≈øides, nothing was concluded upon, and yet the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> withdrew his Troops out of the Eccle≈øia≈øtic State. This was the only thing which the <hi>Barberines</hi> de≈øired, and perhaps the other Powers helped them to deceive the Confederate Princes.</p>
               <p>However, 'tis certain, that during the≈øe divi≈øions, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Troops in <hi>Italy,</hi> took <hi>Nice de la Paille</hi> from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by compo≈øition, dated the 3d of <hi>September.</hi> On the 20th of the following month, the Marquis <hi>de Pianez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> re-took <hi>Verrue;</hi> the taking of which places was of con≈øequence for the time to come; and Prince <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> made him≈øelf ma≈øter of the City of <hi>Tortone</hi> at the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> and of the Ca≈øtle on the 25th of <hi>November.</hi> The King, to recompence the ≈øervices or this Prince, made him a pre≈øent of this Town, and the Territory belonging to it; and after this manner the Campaign ended.

Some propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed <hi>Italy;</hi> but before it would be ≈øafe for them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thither, they mu≈øt de≈øtroy the League, and principally di≈øengage the <hi>Venetians</hi> from it, who ≈øeem'd to be the mo≈øt zealous for the repo≈øe of their Neighbours, and would infallibly take the alarm, if they once ≈øaw a powerful Army on the other ≈øide the Mountains.

The Cardinal li≈øten'd to the≈øe propo≈øals, as a man that had ≈øeveral years to live, and flatter'd him≈øelf that he ≈øhould make great Conque≈øts in a few Campaigns.</p>
               <p>However, to unbend him≈øelf from ≈øo many ≈øerious occupations, which in≈øen≈øibly impair'd his health, he cau≈øed a ≈øtrange ≈øort of a<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 15 <hi>of</hi> Novemb.</note> Comedy to be repre≈øented at his Palace, which contained part of the≈øe thoughts that employed his mind. It was intituled <hi>Europe,</hi> and the principal per≈øon in it was a Lady of that name, who had ≈øeveral Lovers, that endeavoured to gain her good e≈øteem and affection. The two chief Gallants were called <hi>Iberus</hi> and <hi>Francion;</hi> but in the conclu≈øion the merit of the latter carried the fair prize away from his Rival. All the remarkable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences that happen'd ever ≈øince the opening of the War, to the con≈øpiracy of <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> were recited in this compo≈øition.</p>
               <p>However the King tarrying ≈øtill at <hi>S. Germains,</hi> the Council came to no re≈øolution in their Conferences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the War, ≈øo that the Cardinal judged it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to hold it before the King, but he would not go to <hi>S.

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54967:189"/>that the King's Guards were infected with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns of the Ma≈øter of the Hor≈øe.

After he had ≈øeen that Prince tamely abandon his Favourite, and not dare to pardon any one for fear of offending him, he found nothing now that was above him, or that the King was not obliged to do in his favour. He demanded of this weak Prince, that he would ca≈øhier <hi>Tilladet, la Sale, des Effardi,</hi> and <hi>Treville,</hi> Captains in the Guards, again≈øt whom he could alledge nothing, but only that they were not enemies to <hi>Cinq-Mars.</hi> But above all, he would have the la≈øt of the≈øe turn'd out, whom he knew <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> had ≈øollicited again≈øt him, and that he had an≈øwered, he would do every thing that the King commanded him. Being a man of an undaunted, open Spirit, he look'd upon him to be capable to attempt any thing ≈øo ≈øoon as the King ≈øhould mention it to him; and he was jealous of him, becau≈øe he never apply'd him≈øelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o any one but his Maje≈øty. As the Cardinal ≈øhar'd authority with the Prince, and had infinitely more re≈øolution, conduct, and capacity, he imagin'd that all <hi>France</hi> owed no le≈øs to him, than they did to <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. But tho the <hi>French</hi> have naturally a profound veneration for the per≈øon of their Kings, yet they hate their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters when they aba≈øe their power; ≈øo that if the Cardinal knew how to make him≈øelf be feared, yet he could never make him≈øelf be loved.</p>
               <p>At this time he made another reque≈øt to the King, which had it been made to any other King, he would certainly have puni≈øhed the unpardonable in≈øolence of it; and it was as follows, that whenever he ≈øhould go to ≈øee the King for the future, his own Guards might be introduced, and appear in an equal number to tho≈øe of his Maje≈øty. This Prince, who believed that all the good ≈øucce≈øs of his Armies and Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was fa≈øten'd to the per≈øon of his Mini≈øter, and who had been long accu≈øtom'd to have an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kindne≈øs for him, receiv'd the Cardinal's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54967:190"/>very mildly, which would have been High Trea≈øon in any one el≈øe. This dexterous Mini≈øter knowing perfectly well the Genius of his Ma≈øter, and being re≈øolved ≈øtill to inhance his own value with him, at this time gave out that he would no longer concern him≈øelf with public affairs. He no longer gave acce≈øs to the Mini≈øters of foreign Princes at his own Hou≈øe, with a de≈øign, as he pretended, to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage him≈øelf in a ≈øhort time wholly from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry. The King being inform'd of the≈øe di≈øcour≈øes, was mightily alarm'd at the News, and was afraid that the Cardinal thought in earne≈øt to quit that po≈øt, for the con≈øervation of which he had levell'd ≈øo many con≈øiderable Heads, and committed ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acts of inju≈øtice, that I don't believe there had the like been done in ≈øeveral reigns, as during the 18 years of his Mini≈øtry.

               <p>However the King could not re≈øolve at fir≈øt to part with the≈øe Captains, of who≈øe fidelity he had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion to doubt, but the Cardinal to extort it from him, di≈øpatched <hi>Chavigni</hi> one of the Secretaries of State to him, with a writing wherein he de≈øired his Maje≈øty to grant him a di≈øcharge. Upon this the King, contrary to his cu≈øtom, could not forbear to te≈øtify his re≈øentments again≈øt <hi>Chavigni,</hi> forbidding him to come in his pre≈øence.

               <p>The Court being thus purged from the re≈øt of the Factious, as the Cardinals Creatures expre≈øs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, his authority appear'd in its full extent: But at the ≈øame time not only the King's health, who was extremely alter'd ever ≈øince the death of <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> but al≈øo that of the Cardinal began to le≈ø≈øen ≈øen≈øibly, and towards the end of <hi>November</hi> he found him≈øelf ≈øeized with an exceeding pain in his ≈øide, which was accompanied with a Feaver. He had been troubled for ≈øeveral years with the Hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoids, and that di≈øtemper had frequently made him ≈øuffer a great deal of pain, till a Phy≈øician ≈øtopt them. But ever ≈øince that time, as if this too acid blood had thrown it ≈øelf upon the upper parts, he had a defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54967:191"/>upon his arm, to cure which he was forced to employ Cau≈øties. However he pa≈øt the year 1641 without any con≈øiderable inconvenience, but the year following having ≈øtopped the Ulcer in his Arm, in ≈øeems the humour, which had an I≈ø≈øue there, made two impo≈øthumes above his Lungs, which ≈øhortned his days.

               <p>As it u≈øually happens, in ≈øuch di≈øtempers as the Cardinal was troubled with, that the Patients are ≈øometimes better and ≈øometimes wor≈øe, the hopes of the Relations and Creatures of this Mini≈øter increa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dimini≈øh'd by turns, and ≈øometimes joy, and ≈øometimes ≈øadne≈øs was to be read in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.

On the 2d of <hi>December</hi> a con≈øult of Phy≈øicians was held, the re≈øult of which was, that the Cardinal had but a ≈øhort time to live.

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54967:191"/>The Cardinal told him among other thing, <q>That he took his leave of his Maje≈øty, knowing that he was condemned to pay in a ≈øhort time the common Tribute which all men owe to Nature: That he ≈øaid this la≈øt adien to his Maje≈øty with the entire ≈øatisfaction he felt, that he had never done any thing in his whole life contrary to his ≈øervice: That he left <hi>France</hi> in the highe≈øt reputation it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had injoy'd in the world, and her Enemies on the other hand humbled; that he asked no other recompence of his Maje≈øty for all his toils and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, than the continuance of his Royal protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Relations, to whom he would not give his Benediction, but upon the condition they would always pre≈øerve an inviolable fidelity to the King; that la≈øtly, he reque≈øted his Maje≈øty not to change the Mini≈øtry, ≈øince tho≈øe that were then concerned in the admini≈øtration of publick affairs, were extremely fit and capable to ≈øerve the Crown.</q> To the≈øe he added ≈øome important in≈øtructions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the Grandeur of the Kingdom, which were never publi≈øhed, but 'tis ≈øaid they have been ≈øince followed. The King by his an≈øwers te≈øtified how much he was concern'd at the Cardinals condition, and promi≈øed him to protect his Relations, with whom as he ≈øaid he had other rea≈øons to be well ≈øatisfied. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards two yolks of Eggs being brought to him, the King took them and gave them to him with his own hand. After this, he confe≈øt him≈øelf to <hi>M. de Le≈øcot,</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Chartres</hi> elect, from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ab≈øolution.

               <p>Altho he was given over by his Phy≈øicians, and there was no likelihood for him to recover, an Emperic of <hi>Troyes,</hi> named <hi>le Fevre,</hi> being pre≈øented to him, and having boa≈øted extraordinary matters of I don't know what ≈øort of a Water and Pills he had, the Cardinal was willing to try the experiment, whether he knew more than the re≈øt of his profe≈ø≈øion.

The King came to ≈øee him again after dinner, and expre≈øt all imaginable marks of a real affection.

He ≈øaid, that in matters of great importance, he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experimented it, that per≈øons of the lea≈øt wi≈ødom oftentimes gave the be≈øt expedients. For this rea≈øon he concluded that a man ought always to take advice. II.

               <p>Tho≈øe who were Favourites of the King, after the<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Merc. T. 2. l. 8.</note> Con≈øtable <hi>de Luines,</hi> as for example, <hi>Baradas</hi> and <hi>S. Simon</hi> were content to enjoy his Maje≈øty's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, without concerning them≈øelves with State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; but the Cardinal was no ≈øooner taken into favour, but he undertook the admini≈øtration of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54967:194"/>thing. He was arbitrator of all the deliberations in re≈øpect of Peace and of War, Ma≈øter of the Finances, and di≈øpen≈øer of all the King's favours. He di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed of the ≈øtronge≈øt places belonging to the State, and of all Offices that depended upon the Court; ≈øo that the greate≈øt per≈øons ≈øtrove for his favour with no le≈øs zeal and application than even the meane≈øt.</p>
               <p>The King had an extraordinary affection for him at fir≈øt, but this friend≈øhip was mightily le≈ø≈øen'd in his latter years, through the too a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming behaviour of the Cardinal, who often treated him as his equal. Neverthele≈øs the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fearfulne≈øs of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, and the great ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of this Mini≈øter hindered him from find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ill effects of this coldne≈øs. The King had more than once ≈øhown him≈øelf ≈øomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to di≈øcard him from all publick bu≈øine≈øs, e≈øpecially when he ≈øent him word by the Duke of <hi>Angouleme,</hi> as ≈øome report, that he thought it proper for him to di≈ømi≈øs his Guards, which had been granted him for his ≈øecurity: To which the Cardinal made an≈øwer, that he was ready to obey his Maje≈øty in that and every thing be≈øides, but that while the King made u≈øe of his per≈øon, he would pretend to live in ≈øafety, and to pre≈øerve him≈øelf from tho≈øe Con≈øpiracies which ≈øome factious per≈øons might form again≈øt him.</p>
               <p>For fear of being overwhelmed under the weight of public affairs, which the weakne≈øs of his con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not ≈øuffer him to attend perpetually, he a≈ø≈øigned certain hours for recreation, where he would not hear the lea≈øt mention made of any thing that demanded too much application. For this rea≈øon he kept <hi>Boi≈ørobert</hi> about him, who diverted him with a thou≈øand agreeable ≈øtories, and told him all the news of the Court and City, proper to make him laugh. Among his other amu≈øements, we may reckon the great plea≈øure he took to ≈øpeak of the <hi>French</hi> Language and Poetry. The Author of <hi>the Hi≈øtory of the Academy</hi> has related ≈øeveral con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54967:195"/>≈øtories to this purpo≈øe, which I ≈øhall not ≈øet down here, becau≈øe I have propo≈øed to my ≈øelf to write the Hi≈øtory of the Cardinal's Mini≈øtry, and not of his private diver≈øions. The Reader may con≈øult the above-mentioned Author, as for what he ≈øays of our Mini≈øter, upon the occa≈øion of his e≈øtabli≈øhing the <hi>French</hi> Academy. Nay, he gave orders that no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult affairs ≈øhould be propo≈øed to him but one after another; and he employ'd both for his own in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and for tho≈øe of the State, <hi>de Noyers, Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thillier,</hi> and <hi>Chavigni,</hi> altho there were ≈øome which he only communicated to the King.</p>
               <p>After he had taken ≈øuch mea≈øures as he judged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for the pre≈øervation of his own per≈øon, he thought of nothing with more application, than how to maintain him≈øelf in this eminent po≈øt; which it was no ea≈øie matter for him to do, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the great numbers of envious and di≈øaffected people whom he had made. Daily endeavours were u≈øed to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the King with ≈øu≈øpicions to the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of our Mini≈øter; and 'tis certain, that this incon≈øtant, di≈øtru≈øtful Prince, who≈øe dark Genius was ≈øo hard to be found out, gave him no ≈ømall trouble. And therefore, to hinder his Maje≈øty from being prejudic'd again≈øt him, before he could be able to ju≈øtifie him≈øelf, he took care to remove all tho≈øe per≈øons from about him whom he in the lea≈øt ≈øu≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and only left ≈øuch near him as depended ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely upon him≈øelf. As he ≈øaw that the King was ≈øcrupulous, and that the fear of doing ≈øomething again≈øt his Con≈øcience, held him ≈øometimes in a long deliberation, prejudicial to the affairs of the State, he would be the director of his Con≈øcience, and ea≈øe him of tho≈øe ≈øcruples which embara≈øs'd him. He pretended that the Kings Confe≈ø≈øor ought to follow his Maxims, and got Father <hi>Gau≈ø≈øin</hi> the <hi>Je≈øuit</hi> to be di≈ømi≈ø≈øed, becau≈øe he would not be obedient to him.</p>
               <p>The greate≈øt ambition of this Mini≈øter was to reign, and make a noi≈øe in the world; to which end it behoved him to pre≈øerve him≈øelf in his po≈øt, and to render him≈øelf ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54967:195"/>the King. This he effected, by engaging him ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øtingly in ≈øome new enterprize or other, becau≈øe it was an infallible Maxim with this Prince, never to part with any Mini≈øter, till he had concluded the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which he had begun; and be≈øides, he did not look upon him≈øelf to be able to govern the State of him≈øelf. He ≈øaw that the King on one ≈øide was but indifferently affected to the Hou≈øe of <hi>Au≈øtria,</hi> and on the other very much inclined to a Peace. To ≈øatisfie the≈øe two inclinations, he promis'd to humble that Crown ≈øo effectually, that this ≈øhould produce a la≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ≈øecure Peace to <hi>France.</hi> The King, altho of a ≈øoft and peaceable di≈øpo≈øition, yet he was no enemy to what might obtain him a reputation in the world, provided the undertaking would not give him too much trouble; and the Cardinal took care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe ≈øuch projects to him as were proper to make a noi≈øe, and engaged for the ≈øucce≈øs of them. Thus he made him≈øelf Ma≈øter of the King's mind, and did what he plea≈øed under his name.</p>
               <p>For his own glory, he voluntarily engaged in mighty de≈øigns, and as he was fortunate enough in his Wars, ≈øo he lo≈øt no opportunity to make new Conque≈øts, and employ'd all ≈øort of artifiees to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øh them. He laid the foundation of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal Monarchy, and did not de≈øpair of compleating it by the ruin of <hi>Spain,</hi> to which he gave two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous blows, by ≈øupporting the Rebellion of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonians</hi> and <hi>Portugue≈øes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To facilitate the execution of the≈øe va≈øt projects, it was nece≈ø≈øary before all things to ≈øecure <hi>France</hi> from the inva≈øions of her Neighbours, and to put her in a condition to pour down her Forces where-ever ≈øhe ≈øhould ≈øee convenient. This he began to perform with a great deal of ≈øucce≈øs. <hi>Paris</hi> lying too near the Frontiers of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and having been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified more than once by the incur≈øions of the Enemy, ever ≈øince the time of <hi>John de Worth,</hi> the Cardinal endeavour'd to enlarge the Frontiers of the Kingdom on that ≈øide, which he did by the Conque≈øt of <hi>Artois,</hi> and which he had continued by the reduction of ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, which would have ≈øerved as a Rampart
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54967:196"/>to <hi>France,</hi> if he had lived. He colour'd the≈øe de≈øigns with a pretence of recovering what had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Crown. The ≈øame rea≈øon made him undertake the Conque≈øt of <hi>Rou≈øillon,</hi> which if once in her hands, would ≈øecure <hi>France</hi> on the ≈øide of the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> For the ≈øame con≈øideration likewi≈øe, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øed the King to get ≈øome place or other upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whatever it co≈øt him; and this made <hi>France,</hi> after the Death of the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> ≈øeize <hi>Bri≈øac</hi> with that greedine≈øs. And it was for this pro≈øpect al≈øo, that the King could never be brought to ≈øurrender <hi>Pignerol,</hi> that ≈øo he might be in a condition to act in <hi>Italy,</hi> whenever he plea≈øed; for at that time he only made War there for the Reputation of his Crown, and for the Support of his Si≈øter and his Nephew, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> After he had employ'd <hi>Bellievre</hi> in vain, to engage the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in a League again≈øt <hi>Spain,</hi> he no longer thought of making any Conque≈øts there, for it was his opinion, that ≈øuch an enterprize could not ≈øucceed, without the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of at lea≈øt one half of tho≈øe powers, between whom <hi>Italy</hi> is divided.</p>
               <p>A mid≈øt the≈øe projects, relating to the Grandeur of the Crown, and to ≈øatisfye his own Ambition, he took care to provide him≈øelf a ≈øecure retreat, in ca≈øe any misfortune ≈øhould oblige him to retire. For this end he always kept a con≈øiderable ≈øumm at <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> to ≈øerve him in time of nece≈ø≈øity; nay, he had purcha≈øed a Soveraignty upon the <hi>Meu≈øe,</hi> by buying <hi>Chateau-Renaud</hi> in the King's name, and making him≈øelf Ma≈øter of <hi>Charleville.</hi> He likewi≈øe cau≈øed a Royal Fort to be built at ≈øome di≈øtance from <hi>Sedan,</hi> upon a Mountain, with a de≈øign to make him≈øelf Ma≈øter of that City, when time ≈øhould ≈øerve, and not incorporate it to the Crown. For this rea≈øon he forbore to attack it with all the Forces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the beginning of the troubles, rai≈øed by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> as otherwi≈øe he might have done. His de≈øign being to buy it for him≈øelf, ≈øo ≈øoon as he found a favourable opportunity.</p>
