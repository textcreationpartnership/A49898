            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </note> therefore to a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and the Company divided, inſtead of Voting the Confirmation which the King demanded.</p>
               <p>Our Miniſter not able to endure that they ſhould ſhow the leaſt conſideration for his Enemies, perſwaded the King to go quickly to<note n="†" place="margin">The <hi>12th</hi> of May.</note> 
                  <hi>Paris,</hi> to have his Declaration Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and to give ſome Mortification to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The King being arriv'd at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Parliament to come thither in a Body on foot. The Parliament obeyed, and were conducted to the Gallery which joyns the Tuilleries with the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where they found the King under a Canopy raiſed up for that purpoſe. The Lord Keeper Spoke firſt; and after the firſt Ceremonies were over, told the Parliament, That their Power extended onely to the Affairs of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, and not to matters of State, the cogniſance of which belonged to the Supreme Governour: That where a Prince, or Duke, or any Officer of the Crown, receives his Trial for any Miſdemeanour in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Treaſury, or of State-Affairs, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is obliged, either to direct a particular Commiſſion to the Parliament, to enable them to Act in ſuch a caſe; or elſe to be preſent himſelf Perſonally, to Authorize theſe extraordinary Proceedings: That it is true indeed, that to Judge by a Commiſſion required a previous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Cauſe, but that in the caſe of Ratifying a Declaration, which always allows a certain time to thoſe that are Guilty to return to their Duty, there was no need of farther Deliberation. This was as much as to ſay, That the King was willing to make uſe of the Parliamentary Authority, to deſtroy with more formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoſe who favoured his Brother; but would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Parliament the Power of Clearing them if they were innocent.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54967:3"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chateaunouf</hi>'s Diſcourſe being ended, the King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Regiſter of the Parliament to be brought to him, and the Leafe to be ſhewed where the Vote of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was Written, and ſo tore it himſelf to pieces, to have the Decree of the Council inſerted in its place, which Prohibited the Court of Parliament to Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any more upon the Declarations, concerning State-Affairs, upon pain of Interdiction to the Counſellors, and of ſomething worſe, as the King ſhould think fit. 'Twas likewiſe Ordered, That for a Puniſhment of the Fault committed by the Parliament, the Declaration ſent to them ſhould be drawn back, and they Prohibited to take any knowledge of the Contents thereof. For a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his Indignation, the King Suſpended from their Office, and Exiled two Preſidents of the Court of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and a Counſellor, who were nevertheleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after re-eſtabliſhed. The ſame day the Council paſs'd another Sentence againſt the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi>'s Attorney, who Preſented the before-mentioned Petition;
and the King upon that iſſued out<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 26th <hi>of</hi> May.</note> another Declaration upon the ſame Subject, a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Theſe Proceedings againſt the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition were the cauſe that the Queen's Requeſt, which was ſent to the ſame Parliament, Packed up with ſome other Papers, was not onely broke open, but the Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet it ſelf was carried to the King. So that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints which this Princeſs, and Monſieur made againſt the Cardinal, onely ended in a few Printed Pamphlets, which they took care to have thrown about the Streets, or under-hand diſtributed; but there was no Tribunal where they might make their Addreſs; for as to the King's Council, which depended more upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter than himſelf, it was to no purpoſe to make their Application to it. The King himſelf was beſet with People devoted to the Cardinal, whoſe continual buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it was to entertain him in an Ill Humour againſt his neareſt Friends and Relations; and as he beheld nothing but by the Eyes of other People, both his Mother and Brother appeared as Guilty before him, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Cardinal to repreſent them.</p>

He ſaid, amongſt other things, That the Evil Counſellours of his Brother had moved him, contrary to the Duty of his Birth, and to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he owed him to Write him Letters full of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and Seditious Lyes againſt the Government; That againſt all Truth and Reaſon he had Accuſed <hi>his moſt Dear and Well-beloved Couſin the Cardinal of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> of Infidelity, and of harbouring Ill Deſigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Sacred Perſon, that of the Queen, and his own, and againſt the State; That the Queen-Mother had been wrought upon long ago by Ill Counſels, and took more part in the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Deſigns than ſhe ought, being, in all probability, induced to it by the Ill Reports which ſome Perſons profeſſing Curious and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Sciences had ſpread abroad, to give them ſome hopes of a ſudden Revolution: That having deſired the Queen-Mother to aſſiſt him with her Advice, as ſhe had done before; ſhe had Anſwered him, She was weary of meddling with Affairs, and would have no more to do with them; whereby ſhe gave him ſufficiently to underſtand, that ſhe was deeply ingag'd in the Duke's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: That thereupon he had taken a Reſolution to Separate himſelf from her for ſome time <hi>(After this manner did the Cardinal ſpeak of the Impriſonment of the Queen-Mother, which he called a Separation,)</hi> and ſo deſired her to go to <hi>Moulins,</hi> which ſhe refuſed to do; and that ſhe onely offered to go to <hi>Nevers,</hi> while Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur was at <hi>Orleans,</hi> to be nearer to his Perſon, but had refuſed to do it, when ſhe heard that he was gone from thence: That after her departure from <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne,</hi> ſhe had ſent a Requeſt to the Parliament of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> full of falſe and injurious Invectives againſt Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and Written a Letter to His Majeſty, containing ſeveral Studied Pretences to Colour her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, and many Complaints againſt the Cardinal, which had no other foundation, but thoſe Calumnies and Falſhoods which were ſuggeſted by the Ill-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours of Monſieur: That both the one and the other

                  <q>Amongſt thoſe infinite Obligations you have to the King (ſaith he) either for having preſerved your Privileges, or for the great Advantages favourably granted to your Province of <hi>Britany,</hi> even almoſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54967:5"/>to an impoſſibility in regard of the other Provinces of his Realm, you have contracted a new one, which is the greateſt of all; for His Majeſty has given to you Monſieur the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> for your Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whoſe Learning and Piety preferr'd him in his younger years to a Biſhoprick, his Deſerts to a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Cap, his Services and Capacity to the Miniſtry of State Affairs, his Valour to the Generalſhip of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Armies; his Fidelity and Love for the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the Cordial Affection of His Majeſty; and as a Token thereof, and of his Truſt to the High Places and Governments, which he poſſeſſeth and holds from him. All which things, though very conſiderable and great, yet we may ſay nevertheleſs of them, that they onely make up the leaſt part of thoſe recompences which he juſtly deſerves; for having in his firſt Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity confounded Hereſie, in the ſecond maintained the Church, in his Employments ſtrengthened the State by his Counſels, by his Valour pull'd down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated Rebellion, and extended the Limits of <hi>France</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy, Lorraine,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and by his Fidelity, with a continual care, watched for the King's Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; under whoſe Command he hath always acted as a ſecond Cauſe, in thoſe great Affairs, which His Majeſty had, and hath yet, to reſtore the Kingdom to its firſt Splendour.</q> The Prince had better have ſaid, <hi>As a firſt cauſe;</hi> ſince the King did nothing elſe but blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the Motions of his Miniſter, and then he had ſaid at leaſt one true thing in his Speech, which was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of none but ſome Poor Hungry Prieſt, and not of a Prince who aſpired formerly to the Crown. For indeed, What could the King have done more in favour of this Cardinal, but to Aſſociate him to the Crown by a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declaration, or rather to yield it wholly to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering <hi>he had received but the leaſt part of that Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which he deſerved?</hi> After this, there is no reaſon to wonder, that private perſons flattered the Cardinal, ſince the Princes of the Blood offered him their Incenſe in ſo ſhameful a manner. Therefore from this time may we almoſt date the univerſal Extinction of that generous love for Truth, which formerly, if we may ſo expreſs our ſelves, made Martyrs amongſt the very Pagans.

The Cardinal had cauſed the Marquis of <hi>Saint Chamond</hi> to be made Lieutenant for the King in <hi>Provence,</hi> with a Deſign to croſs the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in any thing which he might undertake againſt the Authority of the Miniſtry. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> wrote to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to deſire him to come to <hi>Avignon,</hi> and confer together concerning ſome Affairs relating to the Crown, not telling him what they were. The Duke being offended at this Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſent word back again, he could not go to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince beyond the Confines of <hi>Provence,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Cardinal of the haughty manner he had been dealt with.

               </p>
               <p>This Prince became ſuſpected to the Cardinal,<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri ibid.</hi> P. 444.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was thought that he ſent Money ſecretly to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54967:6"/>Queen-Mother, and that he favoured the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It was for this Reaſon that <hi>Gondi,</hi> who had been at <hi>Florence</hi> for ſome time about his own private Affairs; at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>France,</hi> in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders immediately to be gone, and had much ado to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Permiſſion to ſtay. Once as he had Audience of the Cardinal, this Miniſter gave him a long Narrative of the Diſcontents of the Queen-Mother, and of all that had paſs'd between them ever ſince the Beginning. <q>He aſſured him, that he had never given her any Occaſion to be angry with him, but that ſhe had fallen into a Paſſion upon Trifles; and that by ſuffering her ſelf to be too much influenced by ſome People who deſired nothing ſo much as to cauſe Diſturbances at Court, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to cultivate their own particular Intereſt, ſhe had forſaken the King to embrace the Party of the youngeſt of her Sons; that he (the Cardinal) was willing to withdraw himſelf, to take away all occaſion of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Royal Family; but that the King would not permit him to do it, not believing himſelf to be ſafe without him, and not thinking fit he ſhould have ſo much Condeſcenſion for thoſe who had dealt with him ſo unworthily: ſo that having been thus forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at Court, he was willing, both as a Chriſtian, and as one that had infinite Obligations to Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, to reconcile them together, that he might avoid thereby the Neceſſity of ſerving the King againſt his Mother; that not being conſcious to himſelf of having ever offended this Princeſs, he had deſired of her, that ſhe would be pleaſed to tell him what Reaſons ſhe had to complain of him, and even to ſuppoſe, if ſhe would, any Wrong, which he had never done her, to ſupport what ſhe had ſaid againſt him, becauſe he would not contradict her, and if condemned, he was ready to make her any publick Satisfaction for it; but that ſhe anſwered nothing before the King, but only that ſhe would never be reconciled to him; that the Wrong which ſhe complained to have been done to her, was that which ſhe ſaid the Cardinal had done both to the King and State: That he had ſerved her, during four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years, with all poſſible Fidelity and Zeal; but that being fallen out with him, ſhe would not hearken to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54967:7"/>any Accommodation, and ſought every day an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to have him murther'd; which obliged him to take care for the Preſervation both of his Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and therefore he had not rejected the King's moſt gracious Offers made to him to change thoſe Miniſters who did not pleaſe him: That the Queen was never a Priſoner, and that to ſatisfie her that ſhe was free, they had removed the Soldiers that were about her: That ſhe was to be blamed for retiring into <hi>Spain,</hi> and that Animoſities were now grown to ſuch a degree, that the King could not be reconciled with ſafety.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe made <hi>Gondi</hi> believe the ſame thing, which ſeveral Perſons had already ſuſpected; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Cardinal knew that the Queen had a mind to retire, and therefore was glad to leave her the means to effect it, that ſo he might have an Occaſion to accuſe her of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to hinder the People from being offended at her Baniſhment. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Princeſs, which was linked with that of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi> was extremely weak, as wanting both Friends and Money. The Severities uſed againſt their Followers kept back a great many others who would have otherwiſe joyned with them; nor cou'd the Queen-Mother borrow any Money upon her Jewels, becauſe People feared that the King wou'd demand them again, as belonging to the Crown. The King on his ſide was ſo incenſed againſt his Mother, that there was no likelihood he would truſt her again, as well by reaſon of her Correſpondence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as becauſe ſhe had declared her ſelf for the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who ſhe believed would infallibly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Throne after the King's Death, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Predictions, was to happen very ſoon. To confirm the King in this ill Humour againſt his Mother, an exact Enquiry was made after thoſe Perſons whom the Queen had conſulted to Calculate his Majeſty's Nativity, and <hi>Senel,</hi> Phyſician to the King, and <hi>Du Val,</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Galleys, for having examined it, and made ſiniſter Predictions againſt the Life of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had always entertained a great Correſpondence with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to engage him into his Party; and this Prince raiſed ſome Troops, with an Intention either to take ſome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54967:7"/>Advantage of the preſent Diſturbances, or to put himſelf in a Condition of Defence againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who threatned to invade his Dominions. The Cardinal, who was no Friend to the <hi>Houſe of Lorrain,</hi> and who feared it would ſupport the Party of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> took this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to cauſe a Declaration of War to be publiſhed againſt it. The King ſent the Mareſchals <hi>La Force</hi> and <hi>Schomberg</hi> into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with an Army, and order'd them to take divers Places depending upon the Biſhopricks of <hi>Mets, Toul,</hi> and of <hi>Verdun,</hi> which they ſaid had been uſurped by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> but above all, to attack <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envic,</hi> which the Emperour had poſſeſſed himſelf of by the Counſel, Advice, and Aſſiſtance of this Prince.</p>
               <p>Both the King and the Cardinal deſigned to go perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally thither, but before they went, they reſolved to ſee the Declarations againſt thoſe that eſpouſed the Party of the Queen-Mother, put in Execution. The Court fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if they ſhould remit it to the Parliament, this Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution would go but heavily on, becauſe the Parliament acted only againſt their Wills, and the uſual Formalities ought to be obſerved. Beſides the Injuſtice of proceeding otherwiſe, it was dangerous too violently to countenance the Paſſions of the Miniſter againſt <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who becauſe the King was then without Iſſue, was look'd upon as the next Heir to the Crown. So the Cardinal, who never loved the ancient Proceedings but when they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him, ſo managed matters, that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to conſtitute a Chamber of Juſtice to proceed with Rigour againſt thoſe who favoured his Mother and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and eſpecially againſt ſuch as had retired with them out of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Parliament refuſed to own the Declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eſtabliſhing of this new Chamber, unleſs the Members that ſhould compoſe it were all taken out of their Body. The King ſent to them thereupon a ſpecial Command, to oblige them to let fall this Oppoſition; and the Parliament were contented to ask that the <hi>Subſtitute</hi> and the <hi>Regiſter</hi> of that Chamber ſhould be taken out of their Company. But the Miniſter, being not willing that any one ſhould be enabled either to clear or to delay the Condemnation of thoſe whom he had a mind to deſtroy, engaged the King to eſtabliſh, by his Letters Patent, this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54967:8"/>Chamber in the Arſenal<note n="*" place="margin">The 23th of <hi>September 1631.</hi>
                  </note>, and to admit none into it that were of the Parliament, but only two Counſellors of State, ſix Maſters of the Requeſts, and as many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of the Grand Council. The King afterwards eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed another Chamber of Demeſne, to follow the Court, and to put his Orders in execution.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Parliament ſeeing their Authority would fall at laſt to nothing, and that no body's Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence would be ſecure from the exceſſive Power of the Miniſter, if once it was grown a Cuſtom to act by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Proceedings; ſummon'd an Aſſembly of all the Chambers<note n="†" place="margin">The 28th of <hi>Novemb.</hi>
                  </note>, in which it was concluded, that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance ſhould be made to the King concerning extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Commiſſions; and in the mean while a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition directed to the Commiſſioners to act by vertue of theſe Commiſſions, and an Order ſhould be ſent to the Chevalier <hi>Du Guet,</hi> to put the Judgment of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in execution. They aſſembled themſelves again on the 10th and 12th of <hi>December,</hi> and publiſh'd a Decree purſuant to this Reſolution. The King being informed of it, cauſed this Decree to be diſannull'd by his Council the 16th of <hi>December,</hi> and commanded the Preſidents <hi>Believre</hi> and <hi>Seguier,</hi> who were preſent at this Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Counſellors who ſigned the Decree, and likewiſe the oldeſt Preſidents of the ſecond, third, fourth, and fifth Chambers of Inqueſts, with the moſt ancient Counſellors of each of theſe Chambers, to appear a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after, and attend the Court.</p>
               <p>The King's Army had in the mean while ſeized all the Places in <hi>Lorrain</hi> to which he had any Pretenſions, <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envic</hi> only excepted, which was inveſted in the name of the Biſhop of <hi>Mets,</hi> the King being not willing to declare openly againſt the Emperour. This Place being ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, ſurrender'd on the 27th of <hi>December;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was not in a Condition to oppoſe the Royal Army, thought only how to put a ſtop to its Progreſs, and make the beſt Bargain he could. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to <hi>Mets,</hi> where the King and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal were arrived, who received him very kindly in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance.</p>
               <p>Though the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> had reconciled himſelf to the Cardinal ſome time before, yet this Miniſter gave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54967:8"/>him no marks of his Confidence, till after the Counteſs of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> had propoſed the Marriage<note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>To return now to the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> upon which the Cardinal had likewiſe a watchful eye, the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> came to an Agreement with the Duke of <hi>Guaſtalla,</hi> by the Interpoſition of the Pope's Nuncio <hi>Pancirolo,</hi> and of the Embaſſadors of the Emperour and of the French King.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54967:10"/>Inveſtiture for the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> was remitted to the Biſhop of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guaſtalla</hi> ſent to the Emperour an Act, by which he deſiſted from the oppoſition he had made againſt it. The time ſpecified in the laſt Treaty being at hand, <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Briqueras</hi> were reſtored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Paſſes of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> quitted by the <hi>Imperialiſts.</hi> All the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> except <hi>Porto</hi> and <hi>Canetto,</hi> was ſurrendred to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> withdrew from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and from <hi>Savoy,</hi> while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> left the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> On the 15th of <hi>September Suſa</hi> and <hi>Avilliana</hi> were reſtored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy, Porto</hi> and <hi>Canetto</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> On the 23d the <hi>Germans</hi> departed out of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> at leaſt it was thought ſo. After which the Pope releaſed the Hoſtages.</p>
               <p>All things were ſeemingly in a perfect Peace, when it appeared that on all ſides they onely thought how to deceive one another. <hi>Victor Amadeo</hi> had a long while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go deſign'd to make his Peace with <hi>France,</hi> which had got already a conſiderable part of his State; and <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> who was aware of it, gave him to underſtand, that if he deſired to engage wholly this Crown in his Intereſt, and to remove all Suſpicions on his part, he ought to give to His Majeſty an aſſured Pledge of his Good Will, ſuch as <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and that the King would not be wanting to Recompence him another way.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> was ſo ſtrongly of opinion, that this Place was neceſſary to the Crown, that he could not reſolve to have it reſtored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever inconveniences might ariſe from the contrary. Moſt part of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes confirmed him in theſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the ſecret Sollicitations of their Miniſters to that purpoſe. They were glad that <hi>France</hi> ſhould have a Door open to enter <hi>Italy,</hi> when occaſion ſhould require, to have a Foreign Army to Counter-ballance the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Power of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> By complying thus with their deſires, <hi>France</hi> would recover their Friendſhip, loſt by the Peace of <hi>Lions</hi> (in 1601.) by which they quitted to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the Marquiſate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently gave up the Paſſes of the <hi>Alpes;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King's Authority grew ſo much the greater, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54967:10"/>the Power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was more leſſen'd. Beſides, the Cardinal could not leave behind him a more Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Monument of his good Conduct, than a place of this Importance, which was formerly quitted by <hi>Henry</hi> the III. to the Dukes of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Difficulty was how to find a way to keep it, without breaking the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> but it could not be done againſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Conſent. Therefore the Cardinal, who had already a great Eſteem for <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and knew that he was likewiſe well-accepted by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> charged him with this Negotiation, which he perform'd to his Satisfaction. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having conſented to leave <hi>Pignerol</hi> in the hands of <hi>France,</hi> they got him (beſides what was promiſed to him) the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaves,</hi> which was diſmembred from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Queraſque,</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who knew nothing of the Negotiation concerning <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which was kept ſecret, were ſurpriſed, that <hi>France</hi> ſhould ſpoil the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> their Ally, to ſerve the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had taken Arms againſt them; but time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Myſtery. No noiſe was to be made about it, before <hi>Mantua</hi> was Reſtored; the Paſſages of the Country of the <hi>Griſons</hi> remitted to their Ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the Hoſtages releaſed; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who had a viſible Intereſt in keeping the <hi>French</hi> on the other ſide of the Mountains, would certainly have broken the Treaty, rather than permitted <hi>Pignerol</hi> to remain in their hands.</p>
               <p>It was therefore neceſſary ſo to order Affairs, that if the <hi>French</hi> quitted the Place, in Compliance to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they ſhould be ſecure of returning into it again. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> promiſed to do it after the Execution of the Treaty; and, for a Pledge of his Word, ſent the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> his Brothers, into <hi>France,</hi> under pretence that they were to paſs into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> But the Cardinal feared, leaſt this Prince, to whom this Place was, at leaſt, as Important as it was to <hi>France,</hi> would not be as good as his Word, ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would infallibly be ready to aſſiſt him, in this occaſion, with all their Forces. Therefore they labour'd to find
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54967:11"/>out ſome Stratagem or other to ſecure themſelves of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtill in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> though at the ſame time they made a ſhew of quitting it, ſo that no body ſhould perceive it: This difficult buſineſs was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Marqueſs of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who carried it on in ſuch a manner, that he deceived not onely the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and the <hi>Piedmontois,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>He pick'd out Three hundred Men, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to truſt with a Secret Order he had lately recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the King, which was, to ſend them with all ſpeed to the Cittadel of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and commanded them to ſend away their Baggage with the reſt of the Garriſon, who were diſpoſing themſelves to clear the Place at the time prefixt, being about Three thouſand Men in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and to take their way to <hi>Dauphine.</hi> In the mean time he cauſed them to hide themſelves in ſeveral ſecret holes of the Caſtle, and particularly in an old Garret, where was a long time ago a Door Wall'd up, adjoyning to the Dungeon. <hi>Villeroy</hi> cauſed this Garret to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Partition of Boards, and at one ſide Corn to be laid up; and, on the other ſide, where the Wall'd-door was, lay part of his Men. But becauſe this would have met with very much difficulty in the Execution, if many <hi>Piedmontois</hi> had been in the Place; he cauſed a Report to be ſpread abroad, That the Plague was at <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and particularly in the Cittadel; which put a ſtop to the curioſity of the People from flocking thither, and alſo to the ſpeedy Levies which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> intended to make there for the Garriſon. The Count of <hi>Verrue,</hi> ſent by the Duke to Receive the Place, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Secret, but the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commiſſioners had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of it. As ſoon as they were arriv'd, they ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Troops go out in a File towards <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> took care himſelf to Conduct them to all the Magazines, affecting in this an extraordinary Punctuality, to tire them, and get time, which ſucceeded ſo much the eaſier, becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were unwilling to enter any place that had not been before purifi'd with Fire and Sweet Odours, for fear of catching the Plague. Being entred the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, where the Three hundred Souldiers were hid, the Marqueſs deliver'd up the Gate to the Count of <hi>Verrue,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54967:11"/>who committed it to Fifty or Threeſcore Souldiers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of an Officer; after which he drew the Garriſon out, and led the Commiſſioners to every part of it. The Count had with him a Colonel of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> named <hi>Porporati,</hi> who knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Secret, looked into every Corner with a great deal of Care; ſo that <hi>Villeroy,</hi> fearing leaſt he ſhould diſcover the place where moſt part of his Men were hid, gave a Jog to the Count, and turning himſelf to the Commiſſioners, told them, That it being already pretty late, they would do well to ſend ſome body to viſit the Fort of St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> and this Commiſſion was given to <hi>Porporati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal was ſo entirely reſolv'd not to abandon the Cittadel of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> that <hi>Villeroy</hi> had Orders to Impriſon the Commiſſioners, in caſe they ſhould diſcover the Cheat; and, for this effect, he had along with him Ten or Twelve of the moſt ſtrong and reſolute Fellows, to put his Orders in Execution at the firſt ſign.</p>
               <p>This Reſolution which could not be put in execution, without a Scandalous Violation of the Treaty of <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasque,</hi> and even of the Law of Nations, ſufficiently ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how willing the Cardinal was to keep this Place. By good hap the Commiſſioners were not aware of the Cheat, and <hi>Villeroy</hi> got the very ſame day an Atteſtation from them, by which they acknowledg'd., That <hi>Pignerol</hi> was faithfully deliver'd again into the hands of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards.</hi> He ſent it Poſt to <hi>Ferrara</hi> to have the Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges releaſed.</p>
               <p>Not above four or five Perſons were in the Cittadel to look after the Magazines, and the <hi>Piedmontois,</hi> who were at the Gate, had an Order to let no body in, except one Page of the Count of <hi>Verrue,</hi> to entertain them in the opinion that there was no body in the Cittadel: This buſineſs laſted Two and thirty days, during which the hidden Souldiers did not want Proviſions, for they were abundantly provided before.</p>
               <p>Now it was neceſſary to draw theſe Souldiers out of their holes, and to perſwade the World, That they were got in again in ſpight of the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore they onely look'd for a Pretence, which would not have been ſo eaſie a thing to find, if the Duke
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54967:12"/>of <hi>Feria,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> had been more quick in executing the Treaty of <hi>Querasque,</hi> who, fearing leaſt the <hi>French</hi> would not anſwer his honeſt and fair Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, retained Two <hi>German</hi> Regiments in the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and ſome <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Cavalry, whom he had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to diſmiſs. The <hi>French</hi> being informed of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun immediately to complain highly of it, and to ſay, That Count <hi>Merode</hi> threatned again to invade the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Great Sums of Money which <hi>Spain</hi> was accuſed to furniſh the Queen-Mother with, did not help a little to heighten theſe Complaints, and they were carried to the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> in very high words, purpoſely to exaſperate the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction or other, which might give occaſion to the <hi>French</hi> to ſay, That they were conſtrained by the Duke's Contraventions, to Poſſeſs themſelves again of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On his ſide <hi>Feria</hi> begun likewiſe to complain of the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe the Garriſons of <hi>Mantua</hi> and of <hi>Caſal</hi> were full of Souldiers of their Nation, and the <hi>Griſons</hi> Fortified the Paſſage of <hi>Steich,</hi> againſt the Treaty of <hi>Monzon.</hi> He Publiſh'd a Writing, in which he expos'd at length the Infractions which he thought the <hi>French</hi> had made againſt that of <hi>Queraſque,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>That they might be followed with greater Inconveniencies.</hi> The Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> who ſought after a Quarrel, took up theſe words, as if the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> had meant, That as ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> Troops were gone out of <hi>Italy,</hi> he would Revenge himſelf of thoſe Infractions he imputed to them. Furthermore, they had notice, that the Emperour, at the Inſtance of <hi>Spain,</hi> had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red void the Inveſtiture ſent to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> ſhould be exactly obſerved; and thereupon the <hi>French</hi> gave out, That the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had a Deſign to Invade a-new the States of the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this they diſperſed a Manifeſto, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> though they complained of him in publick, in which, after great Complaints againſt the Unfair Dealings of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their Allies, and eſpecially of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to carry on their Trick
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54967:12"/>more ſecretly, they declared, that the King was reſolved to ſecure the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to protect his Allies there. For this purpoſe, <hi>Servien</hi> ask'd the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> to deliver back ſeveral Places in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, <hi>Pignerol,</hi> for the Reception of the <hi>French</hi> Army which was to paſs thither again. The Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> proteſted before God and Men, that it was not out of any Ambitious Motive, or to diſturb the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> that the King their Maſter demanded theſe Places; but on the contrary, to make it more firm, and to give the Allies that Peace, which they deſired ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to enjoy.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſo carried himſelf, as if he thought this Demand very ſtrange, and told <hi>Servien</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he had to deny it; but <hi>Servien</hi> replied, That if he would not grant, of his own free accord, what the King deſired, the Army which was in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and in <hi>Provence,</hi> ſhould repaſs the Mountains by force, for the Security of his Allies. He allowed the Duke Three Days to conſider of it, after which he threatned him, in caſe of Denial, with the Invaſion both of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi> In the mean while this Prince ſent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> with the Pretenſions of the <hi>French,</hi> and to Ask Succours of him to oppoſe this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Invaſion. The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> offered him all the Aſſiſtance which was in his Power. When they came to the Particulars, this Prince Ask'd for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Savoy</hi> Ten thouſand Foot, and a Thouſand Horſe, and half that number for <hi>Piedmont,</hi> beſides his own Troops. He thought this would ſuffice for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſince Winter was ſo near. He deſired alſo that <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould immediately Pay him off all the Arrears due to him, which His Catholick Majeſty had Promiſed him, after which, they might at leaſure Diſcourſe of what was Neceſſary to be done for the future. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> knew that it was impoſſible for the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to ſatisfie his Demands, and he made them on purpoſe, that they ſhould not think it ſtrange if he delivered <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> ſeeing they were not in a condition to Protect him againſt them. The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> Anſwered, That he would immediately ſupply him with what Help he could, and that as ſoon as the New
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54967:13"/>Levies were made in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> he would ſend them with all ſpeed to him. In the mean while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> offered to enter into Negotiation with the <hi>French</hi> upon this matter, but <hi>Servien</hi> would not hearken to it before the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had Anſwered his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To deceive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> effectually, the Duke Aſſembled<note n="*" place="margin">The 19th of <hi>October.</hi>

The Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> feigned likewiſe to interpoſe with her Brother for the Moderation of the Demands which <hi>Servien</hi> had made. They agreed afterwards upon theſe Articles; That the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhould neither directly nor indirectly help thoſe who would endeavour to cauſe any Diſturbance in <hi>France</hi> during the Abſence of the Queen-Mother, and of the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> That he ſhould grant free Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the <hi>French</hi> Troops, in caſe there ſhould be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſend them again into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> or the Peace came to be diſturbed on the ſide of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> or of <hi>Mantua:</hi> That to give a Pledge to the <hi>French</hi> King that he would keep his Word, he ſhould depoſite the Town and Cittadel of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> with the Three Forts of <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> who were intruſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>Suſa:</hi> That the ſame <hi>Swiſſes</hi> ſhould take an Oath, That they would faithfully keep theſe Three Places during Six Months; at the end of which they ſhould reſtore them to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> unleſs the Prince ſhould think fit, in caſe the ſame Conjunctures happened, to have their Truſt further prolonged: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that His Majeſty might put a Governour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Place, who ſhould take the ſame Oath. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, with the conſent of the Duke, a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon was exchang'd with that of the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> and the Three hundred Souldiers came out of the places where they had hid themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> gave notice to Duke <hi>Feria</hi> of the Articles he had Agreed upon with the <hi>French.</hi> The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> durſt not diſapprove wholly the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Conduct, though he thought it would
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54967:13"/>be highly prejudicial to <hi>Italy.</hi> Thus the <hi>French</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to re-enter into the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which they had not quitted; and they afterwards engag'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to yield it up wholly to them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not perceiving (at firſt) the Trick which was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. As the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters in <hi>Italy</hi> were blamed for their want of Conduct, ſo it was thought very ſtrange, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for ſome Lands in <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> which <hi>France</hi> cauſed to be given him, by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Queraſque,</hi> ſhould voluntarily tie up his own hands by parting with <hi>Pignerol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was reduc'd by this War to ſuch Extremities, that he depended wholly upon <hi>France,</hi> and durſt not contradict them in the leaſt. So that at the ſame time that the <hi>French</hi> were buſie to ſecure <hi>Pignerol</hi> for themſelves, he was oblig'd to permit them to ſend a ſtrong Garriſon to the Cittadel of <hi>Caſal,</hi> for fear the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Pignerol,</hi> ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make themſelves Maſters of it. This buſineſs was likewiſe carried on with ſo much ſecrecy, that they knew nothing of it in <hi>Italy,</hi> till after Two <hi>French</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had got into <hi>Caſal.</hi> As ſoon as the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, who were jealous of the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> knew that the <hi>French</hi> were in Poſſeſſion of theſe two Places, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Treaty of <hi>Queraſque,</hi> they ſhewed in all parts how well they were pleaſed with it, and eſpecially the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were not in favour with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and feared its Reſentments.

He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd himſelf likewiſe, to turn out of his Dominions all the King's Enemies, and all his Subjects, who had left the Kingdom without his Leave, and to deny them for the future any Paſſage or Retreat.</p>
               <p>A little while after, the Deputies of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> came to <hi>Metz,</hi> where the King was.<note n="†" place="margin">Siri Mem. <hi>Rec.</hi> Tom. 7.

               <p>Monſieur, who was then at <hi>Nancy,</hi> was oblig'd to withdraw, and to retire to the Low-Countries; and the French Army advanc'd to the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> as if they would have favour'd <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus;</hi> though at the bottom, <hi>France</hi> began to grow jealous of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to fear leaſt the Emperour and the Catholick League ſhould wholly ſink under the power of his Arms.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec,</hi> T. 7. Pag. 475.</note> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> deſired extreamly to have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. being uſed to manage his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations himſelf; and the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhew'd on his ſide a great Inclination to ſee <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> for fear of offending him. But this Prince had quite other things in his Thoughts, and durſt not expoſe himſelf to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, which had turned wholly to the Honour of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to whom he was not to be compar'd for the Qualities either of Body or Mind.</p>
               <p>So a little time after, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the French King being indiſpoſed, was not in a condition to come to an Interview; therefore it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to him, that he would be pleaſed to meet Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who was more fit to treat with <hi>Guſtavus</hi> than <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, who referr'd every thing to his Miniſter. <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> who was of a haſty Temper, anſwered, he would ſend one of his Servants to confer with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; that he eſteemed himſelf not inferiour to the French King, and did not underſtand why he ſhould decline to meet him; that the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Kings never truckled to thoſe of <hi>France;</hi> and that all Crowns were equal.</p>
               <p>Theſe Expreſſions of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> beſides that he was ſuſpected of aſpiring to no leſs than an Univerſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, cooled very much the Deſign which the French had to aſſiſt him, and hinder'd the King, at that time, from declaring openly againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Beſides, the Cardinal had ſome particular Reaſons which kept him back from engaging himſelf in great Enterpriſes, in which <hi>France</hi> might perhaps not always get the better. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Averſion of the Queen-Mother, and of Monſieur to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; the hatred even of almoſt the whole Kingdom, not to mention the Foreign Powers whom he had mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended, and the little Certainty he had that the King, upon whoſe Affection his Fortune was built, would live long; all this made him very often think of his own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54967:15"/>in caſe any ſiniſter Accident ſhould befall him.</p>
               <p>To ſhelter himſelf againſt all Misfortunes, he deſign'd at this time to marry his Niece <hi>Combalet</hi> with the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> to whom he made very advantageous Offers. He pretended to put him in a Condition not only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to be a Support to the Relations of his Lady, but alſo almoſt of giving Laws to the King himſelf. The Count conſented to it, but was deſirous that the King ſhould declare in Writing, that he promoted this Marriage as being advantageous both for his Service and the Good of the State; and that for this Reaſon he commanded him to marry the Cardinal's Niece. The Miniſter, whom the King humoured in all things, thought he might eaſily obtain this Favour, and demanded it, though without the return of any poſitive Anſwer. He continued then to treat of this Buſineſs himſelf, and had his Propoſitions carried to the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> by his Creatures; but at laſt he perceived that this Marriage diſpleaſed the King, becauſe he had very good reaſon to believe that it would make the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> too powerful; that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was an Enemy to the Count, would joyn with the Diſaffected; and that conſequently the King would find himſelf alone with the Count, and draw upon him all the Enemies of the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>This Prelate coming to underſtand the Sentiments of his Majeſty upon this Affair, ſhewed an entire Submiſſion to his Will, and gave out that his Niece was going to retire into a Nunnery, though nothing was ſo far from her Thoughts. It was ſecretly whiſper'd to the King, that this Marriage would render the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> too greats and that it would utterly diſoblige the Queen-Mother and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whom, neither in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor even in good Politicks, he could always keep out of the Kingdom. In the mean while the Cardinal, who was uſed to Refuſals, feared leſt the King's Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him ſhould change, and he was obſerved to be very ſad for ſome days.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> weary of publiſhing his Praiſes without any Advantage to himſelf, and angry at the Marriage which was propoſed, inſtead of going to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Eſtates of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> retired to <hi>Bruges.</hi> In order to hinder him from having any Communication with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54967:15"/>of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Berry,</hi> it was thought neceſſary to cauſe ſome Forces to advance to the River <hi>Loire</hi> to guard the Paſſes. But there was no Neceſſity for this Precaution, as a little time made it appear.</p>
               <p>The Duke<note n="*" place="margin">Aubery'<hi>s Life of the Card.</hi> Lib. 4. Cap. 24.</note> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> offered his Mediation to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the King with Monſieur, and received this Anſwer, that if that Prince would return into <hi>France,</hi> a general Pardon ſhould be granted to all thoſe who had followed his Party; and that they ſhould be re-eſtabliſh'd in their Eſtates and Dignities, except only in the Governments which they poſſeſſed before. But theſe, who far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to come and ſurrender themſelves to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, intended not to go home, unleſs they could be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Gainers by the Bargain, perſwaded Monſieur to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject theſe Offers; and the D. of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who ſaw very well that their Return upon theſe Conditions would only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Authority of the Cardinal, a profeſſed Enemy to his Houſe, was the firſt who adviſed Monſieur to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Right by force of Arms, and begun himſelf to make new Levies again, for fear of being ſurpriſed as he was before; and ſoon after, Monſieur, who was retired to <hi>Flanders,</hi> returned into <hi>Lorrain</hi> with ſome Forces, which he joyned with thoſe of the Duke.</p>
               <p>Both the King and the Cardinal were gone into <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> to oppoſe the Enterpriſes of the diſaffected Perſons, who kept private Correſpondences there. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Calais,</hi> one of thoſe who declared for Monſieur, was reduced to his Duty by the King's Arrival, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned afterwards to <hi>Saint Germain.</hi> The Cardinal in this Journey was ſeized with a ſmall Fit of an Ague, which detained him two days at <hi>Corbie,</hi> though it never hinder'd him from taking care of the Publick Affairs, and ſoon after he follow'd the King. As ſoon as his Majeſty received the News of Monſieur's Return into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> he ſent the Mareſchal <hi>d' Effiat</hi> thither to Command the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with Mareſchal <hi>La Force,</hi> and gave him Orders to enter again into the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Territories, and to oppoſe the March of Monſieur, in caſe they could not oblige the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> by way of Negotiation, to obſerve the Treaty of <hi>Vic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Promiſes and Threatnings made uſe of to win that Prince, were ineffectual, till he ſaw an Army, and

               <p>The Duke not being in a condition to make farther Reſiſtance, was glad to come to an Accommodation, and the Treaty was concluded on the 26th of <hi>June</hi> by his Deputies and Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who was deſirous to return into <hi>France</hi> with all ſpeed, to oppoſe and fruſtrate Monſieur's Deſigns.

The Cardinal, who was in good hopes that the Court would have ſentenced him to death, cauſed the Commiſſion to be recalled, and the Judges to be diſcharged. The Mareſchal was ſome time after removed from <hi>Verdun</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> and from thence to the Village of <hi>Ruel.</hi> The King eſtabliſhed there a Chamber of Juſtice by another Commiſſion of the 11th of <hi>March</hi> 1632. They were in part the ſame Judges, and ſome others who were put in the room of thoſe that were rejected, and they were four and twenty in number.</p>

In order to oblige the Judges to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him to death, the King's Attorney cited a Statute which condemned thoſe who were found guilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding the Publick Treaſury, to have both <hi>their Eſtates and Bodies confiſcated:</hi> but the reſt maintained, that in this caſe, thoſe Expreſſions imported no more than the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their Eſtates, and Impriſonment. Finally,<note n="*" place="margin">The 8th of <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note> the Chamber, without any Examination of moſt part of the Heads of Accuſation which were produced againſt him, came to paſs Sentence. Ten of his Judges voted for Life, and thirteen for Death: ſo that according to the form of Criminal Judgments, he was condemned but by one Vote. Moſt part of them were excepted againſt, for very weighty Reaſons; as particularly, for publick and long profeſſed Enmity. Whereas in Criminal Matters, it is uſual to gather the Votes three times one after another, to give them time in caſe they ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to change Opinion, hardly were they once collected, but their <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> Preſident of the Chamber, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Sentence of Death, and ſent to give notice of it to the King.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were the Mareſchal's Relations informed that Sentence had paſſed upon him, but they went Poſt to <hi>Saint Germain,</hi> to beg his Life of the-King. They thought they muſt addreſs themſelves firſt to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to try if he would not have the Generoſity to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for him after he had ſollicited his Condemnation. Having made their Complements to him, the Cardinal, as if he had been wholly ſurprized at it, aſſured them that they told him of a thing which he knew nothing of; that he was heartily ſorry that the Mareſchal <hi>de Marillac</hi> had brought himſelf to that condition by his own Fault; to which he added, <hi>See the King, he is merciful.</hi> The Relations of the Mareſchal having ask'd him again, if he would not do them the Favour to ſpeak of it to the King, and to intercede for him, the Cardiral reply'd, <hi>I told ye that ye ſhould ſee the King.</hi> When they threw themſelves at his Majeſty's feet, and ſollicited for his

They immediately retired, and went again the next day to wait upon the Cardinal, and were ſcarcely got into the Anti-Chamber, when the Prelate going by, while they were bowing to him, asked them, <hi>Well Gentlemen, have you ſeen the King?</hi> one of them reported to him the King's Anſwer; to which the Cardinal replied, <hi>I would adviſe you to obey the King.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this another began to ſupplicate him, that he would be pleaſed to intercede for them, during their Abſence, with the King: but the Miniſter, not being able to contain his Paſſion any longer, returned them this bitter and ſharp Anſwer; <hi>I did adviſe you to withdraw, ſince the King charged you to do ſo: but now I command you, in the King's name, to depart.</hi> This Anſwer made them underſtand that the Death of the Mareſchal was fully reſolved upon, and he was accordingly executed at the <hi>Greve</hi> the 10th of <hi>March,</hi> proteſting his Innocence. 'Twas not uſual in <hi>France</hi> to puniſh Publick Embezzling with Death: and indeed, this was not the Crime for which he was brought to the Scaffold.</p>
               <p>He had the Boldneſs<note n="*" place="margin">

Which Crime, this good Prelate could never forgive him. As for his Brother, the Keeper of the Seals, he was conducted to <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> where he dyed ſoon after: And ſo the Cardinal ſaw himſelf delivered from two Enemies, whom he might have feared if they had been alive.</p>
               <p>They ſay that the Cardinal went himſelf to ſollicit all the Judges, one after another, the day before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Mareſchal to die: and yet 'tis alſo reported, that when they went to viſit him, in hopes of receiving Thanks for it, the Cardinal told them, in a jeering way, <q>I muſt confeſs that God does inſpire Judges after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner than he does the other Men, ſince they could find ſufficient Matter to condemn Mareſchal <hi>Marillac.</hi>
                  </q> It was however publiſh'd after his Death, that the Queen-Mother had corrupted him to favour the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and in <hi>Germany;</hi> but that no mention was made of it at his Tryal in reſpect to her.</p>

It was pretended, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had a Deſign to make a Deſcent into the Iſlands of <hi>Hieres,</hi> and to Fortifie themſelves there, at the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> This Prince made all his endeavours to juſtifie himſelf, and to obtain the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to return into <hi>France;</hi> but as he deſired ſome ſecurity, he had for an Anſwer, That nothing but his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence would be a ſafety to him; ſo that he durſt not expoſe himſelf to the King's Juſtice, who look'd upon all ſuch to be guilty who had the misfortune to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>During the ſame time, the <hi>French</hi> endeavoured to maintain themſelves in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who ſaw that he could not refuſe them the Place, was onely thinking how to make the beſt Bargain that he could for it.

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54967:18"/>(as 'twas ſaid in the Declaration) <hi>he Declares, That what he did was for the ſafety and wellfare of</hi> France, <hi>which he repreſented in a Deplorable Condition, in Terms extreamly prejudicial to the honour of his Majeſty, laying the fault of all upon the Cardinal</hi> Richlicu; <hi>though it might be juſtly ſaid, that the Kingdom was never ſo powerful nor in ſo great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before, and that the Cardinal's Fidelity and Zeal and the Merits of his Services were ſo well known to all the World, that none but thoſe who were envious both of the Glory of his Majeſty and of his Proſperity, would offer to ſay any thing to the contrary.</hi> Laſtly, the King declared afreſh, thoſe who ſhould joyn with Monſieur, or abert him in any manner whatſoever, Rebels, and guilty of High Treaſon; and commanded they ſhould be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt with all the Severity of the Laws. As for the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> himſelf, he gave him ſix Weeks time to return to his Allegiance.</p>
               <p>In the mean while an Army was ſent againſt Monſieur, in two Bodies; one of which was commanded by the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force,</hi> and the other by Mareſchal <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</hi> They advanced two different ways, to endeavour to get between them the Troops of Monſieur, who were not in a condition to make any great reſiſtance.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7. Pag. 553.</note> Though they had obeyed the King, yet it was with very much reluctance that they accepted the Command upon this Occaſion; and eſpecially the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> did what lay in his power to be excuſed. It ſeemed to him, that it was too great a Boldneſs in a Subject to go and attack the King's only Brother, and preſumptive Heir to the Crown, his Majeſty being not preſent. It might happen that in the heat of Battel the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> might be kill'd, and the Fault then would be laid on the Mareſchal, which would be enough to ruin him under another Adminiſtration. And therefore that he might act with greater Safety, he deſired that the King would give him preciſe Orders what he was to do; and the King declared that as to his Brother's Perſon, he would not have him come by any harm, and that they ought to treat him with reſpect. Upon this the Mareſchal obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that in a Fight it would not be poſſible perhaps to diſtinguiſh him; and ſince this Inconvenience could not well be avoided, and would cauſe the Armies to act but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54967:19"/>weakly againſt Monſieur in the King's Abſence, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty reſolved at laſt to go perſonally with them.</p>
               <p>Monſieur found none of the Provinces in his March diſpoſed to declare for him, becauſe the Governour who knew his Temper, knew likewiſe that he had neither Conduct, nor Experience, nor Conſtancy enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thoſe that ſhould declare for him. Only the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> promiſed to favour him, to revenge the Wrong which he thought the Cardinal had done him. He had formerly ſurrender'd his Office of Admiral, at his Sollicitation, who inſtead of ſuppreſſing it, as he had pretended before, appropriated it to himſelf, under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Title. 'Twas ſaid that he gave the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> great hope of having the Office of High Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was more conſiderable, and had been poſſeſſed by his Father and Grandfather; but he cauſed both the Title and the Donations of that great Poſt to be aboliſh'd, ſo that the Duke having ask'd for the Office of <hi>Mareſchal General of the King's Armies,</hi> which was the ſame Thing under another Name, he met with an abſolute Denial. Yet notwithſtanding theſe and other Occaſions of Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he ſtill remained in the Intereſts of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal till the time of the King's Sickneſs at <hi>Lions.</hi> But whether he grew weary to live under the Authority of a Miniſter who would not have Friends but Slaves; or that <hi>Marie Felice des <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins,</hi> his Lady, who was related to the Queen-Mother, had drawn him to the Party of this Princeſs, he engaged his Word to Monſieur, ſince this Prince's Departure from Court.</p>
               <p>Ar firſt he looked for ſome Pretence or other to make Levies, without giving ſuſpicion to the Court; but at laſt having<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Siri Mem. Rec.</hi> T. 7.

As for their Succours of Men, they came not at all. So that when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54967:19"/>Monſieur entred into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to oppoſe the King's Forces. Nevertheleſs there was a neceſſity to receive him, and he entred into <hi>Lunel</hi> on the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> after having ſecured ſome few Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to himſelf. He had a conſiderable ſum of Money at his Palace in <hi>Paris,</hi> which he expected to receive in a ſhort time; but the Court having had notice of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ſtopped it, ſo that Monſieur's Party was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſtitute of every thing; and when the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his March, to go and joyn Mareſchal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who followed the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> he was not in a condition to make a long reſiſtance, if the Royal Armies had been once joyned together. Monſieur had then Two thouſand Foot, and Three thouſand Horſe, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Voluntiers, and Three Pieces of Canon. And Mareſchal <hi>Schomberg</hi> had not yet above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and Twelve hundred Horſe, without Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Mareſchal being advanced near to <hi>Caſtelnau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darry,</hi> drew up his Troops in Battel on the Firſt of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> the Enemy being not far from him. Whether the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was deſirous to open the Campagne with ſome Action that might give reputation to his Party, or whether he judged it expedient to fight the Royal Army, while they were inferiour to him in number; he took upon himſelf the Command of the Van of the Army, and Monſieur that of the Main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The Count <hi>de Moret</hi> was the firſt who fell upon the King's Horſe, and put them into diſorder; and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> perceiving it, pour'd in full ſpeed with very few Men, and forgetting to diſcharge the part of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he expoſed himſelf to all the dangers of a Private Souldier, and fought with extraordinary bravery. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, ſome Foot, who were laid in an Ambuſh in the Ditches, ſuddenly got up, and made their Diſcharge ſo fortunately, that the Counts of <hi>Moret,</hi> of <hi>Rieux,</hi> of <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illade,</hi> and ſeveral Officers were killed, and the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> wounded in ſeveral parts of his Body. He might have withdrawn himſelf, if at the ſame time,

                  <hi>Bullion</hi> told this Prince, That the beſt and onely way he had to obtain what he requeſted, was to ſubmit himſelf wholly to the King's Will; that to deſire an aſſurance of it, would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to him, and an offence to that Truſt he ought to have in his Clemency; That this being a Pardon which was wholly to redound to the King's Glory, he wrong'd the Duke of <hi>Montmonency,</hi> in not leaving it at His Majeſty's Diſpoſition; that the blind obedience he ſhow'd the King upon this occaſion, ought to put him out of fear, and give him hopes as certain as he could deſire. Theſe Diſcourſes of <hi>Bullion</hi> perſwaded the Duke, That he had Orders from the King, to ſpeak to him in this manner, and hindred <hi>Gaſton</hi> from drawing any poſitive word for the liberty of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency.</hi> Whether <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> and the reſt, whoſe Advice Monſieur required in every thing, were not ſorry to ſee the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> ſacrificed, or whether they did not perceive the Artifice of <hi>Bullion;</hi> certain it is, that they committed in this occaſion a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious fault, which diſcredited their Party for good
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54967:20"/>and all. Thus did it appear evidently by Monſieur's Conduct, that thoſe who Govern'd him, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deceive any body but himſelf.

                     <hi>Hiſt. of</hi> Lewis XIII. <hi>by</hi> Ch.

               <p>The King, on his ſide, granted His Pardon to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, and to his Domeſticks, and moreover to the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> whom he reſtored to his Eſtate, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reſide in one of his Houſes, that ſhould be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by His Majeſty.

               <p>He wrote another Letter to the King, wherein he earneſtly deſired him to forgive the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> but to no purpoſe. As ſoon as he was taken, it was debated in a ſecret Council what to do with him, and 'tis confidently reported, that care was taken already to incenſe the King againſt him, by telling him, That they had found about his Arm a Locket of Gold, to which was tied the Picture of a certain Lady in Miniature, for whom His Majeſty had a great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Pompone de Bilievre</hi> Intendant in Mareſchal <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s Army took it dexterouſly from him at his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and took the Picture from it; but as this was done in preſence of ſeveral perſons, notice was given

               <p>After he had thus produc'd his Reaſons in favour of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> the Cardinal turned the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ſaid, <q>That on the other ſide, if they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that the King was without Children, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur look'd upon as Preſumptive Heir to the Crown, they would find, that if thoſe who followed his Party, were not rigorouſly puniſh'd; the firſt time the King fell Sick, how inconſiderable ſoever his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be, ſo many People would declare for the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that the King would not be able to Maſter them: That on the contrary, if the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was brought to Deſerved Puniſhment, no body would dare to engage in ſuch Attempts any more; That not a ſew Kings, whom he named, had
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54967:22"/>maintained themſelves in the declenſion of their Age, only by Severity; he cited ſome Examples, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, ſaying, That if the Nobility and Commons ſhould once know, that the conſideration which the King had for Monſieur was capable to hinder Seditious Perſons from being puniſhed with Death, there would be ſtill great Numbers of Perſons, who, thinking their Lives in ſafety, would venture their Eſtates and Fortunes for him, in hopes of being gainers at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Kingdom: That turning Men out of their Offices in ſuch an occaſion, ſignified nothing, without taking their Lives away, becauſe Monſieur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſider'd as next Heir to the Crown, thoſe who ſhould loſe their Offices for taking up Arms for him, would hope to recover them with uſury, as ſoon as this Prince aſcended the Throne: That <hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s Crime was not a Simple Rebellion, in which Monſieur had engaged him, but that he had Incited the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to enter into <hi>France</hi> with Arms, and raiſed up the Province, by Summoning an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the States, a thing that was never practiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: That it would be very difficult and dangerous to keep him in Priſon: That in ſtead of extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Party, it would be revived, and gather more ſtrength than before. That Monſieur ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the King out of Neceſſity, and not out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would prove always the ſame, and the Queen-Mother would ſtill perſiſt in her Anger: That <hi>Puilaurens</hi> would have no leſs credit with Monſieur than before, and that his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Intreaguing with the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue: So that the danger being over, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> would hearken to bad Counſels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: That if they thought fit to forſake the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the Rage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ceaſe; and if they would Sacrifice to the Queen-Mother all thoſe whom ſhe hated, and put the King in a total Dependance upon her, her Animoſity might likewiſe be at an end; but if none of theſe things cou'd be done, as really the King could do neither of them without undoing himſelf, 'twas certain that the more Monſieur's Party ſubſiſted in the Heads of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54967:22"/>it, the greater the danger wou'd be, by reaſon of their continual Cabals, and becauſe the danger, when it was once over, was reckon'd for nothing: That the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> being Puniſhed, his Party would fall in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and that of Monſieur all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>France;</hi> whereas if he was kept a Priſoner, though never ſo many beſides were Executed, he would have always ſecret Friends, and ſo much the more true to him, that they ſhould have no other hopes but in his re-ſtabliſhment, which conſequently they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure by all ways whatſoever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards the Cardinal begun to Confute the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he had at firſt propoſed, to favour the Pardon which Menſieur demanded for the Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</hi> He ſaid, <q>That the Promiſes which Monſieur made to obtain what he deſired, wou'd be indeed conſiderable, had he not broken his word three times, though he had been very kindly uſed by the King, and ſeen all his Houſhold rewarded with extraordinary Favours; but after this it would be imprudently done to truſt him: That if Monſieur could not ſave the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Life, he would find fewer People ready to ſerve him than if he ſaved him; and that this Reaſon alone was ſufficient for to have him Puniſhed: That Monſieur being not able to procure his Pardon, would not ruine himſelf, becauſe of his Death, and that the neceſſity of leaving him to the Severity of his Sentence, wou'd ſecure his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince it is better at laſt to have an Arm cut off, than to loſe ones Life: That ſuppoſe Monſieur ſhould paſs into <hi>Spain,</hi> uppon the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Puniſhed, yet his Power would be ſo much Clipp'd, that he would never be able to ſet up another Party: That indeed, the Miniſters who declar'd for Severity in this occaſion, expos'd themſelves very much; but when the Service of King and State were called in queſtion, they ought not to have any regard to their particular Intereſt. Laſtly, The Cardinal concluded, That to grant the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Life to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur's Requeſt, would ſtrengthen his Party, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that of the King: nevertheleſs, the King might Grant it out of His meer Bounty, and not being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54967:23"/>to it by a Treaty; but there was more danger in the doing, than in not doing of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Council yielded to the Cardinal's Advice, which no body ever contradicted Unpuniſhed, in Affairs of any moment. The King, who naturally was inclined to Severity, and to whom Generoſity was almoſt an unknown Vertue, embraced, in this occaſion, as in all others, the moſt Rigorous Party.<note n="†" place="margin">Aubery<hi>'s Life of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Rich.

It was onely done with a deſign to lay a Cenſure upon the States, for ſuffering themſelves to be ſeduced by the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> and to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the puniſhing of ſome Biſhops and Gentlemen, who had declared for him.</p>
               <p>From thence the Court repaired to <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> where the Parliament took in hand the Trial of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> though it belonged, by Right, to that of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Cardinal, who did not love delays, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Ruine of his Enemies was to be effected, moved the King to nominate this Parliament to be the Judges in this Cauſe. <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> formerly Page to Conſtable <hi>Montmorency,</hi> Father to the Priſoner, and Six Maſters of the Requeſts came thither to Preſide at this Judgment; and forasmuch as the Duke of <hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> was taken in Arms againſt His Majeſty, and declared Guilty of High-Treaſon, after Examination, and a free Confeſſion on his part, he was Condemned to<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54967:24"/>though they had no other intention than to ſerve him; and that if he had then abandoned them to the ſeverity of the Laws, and of Juſtice, he would have deprived himſelf, both of the moſt profitable Services of the one, and of the grateful Acknowledgments of the other: That the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s youth ought to be no leſs an excuſe to him, than their honeſt Intentions had been to them: That his Perſon being in the hands of His Majeſty, he was not able to do him the leaſt Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but his Conſervation wou'd be an eternal Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to His Glory. He deſired the King to conſider, that in this young Duke's Perſon alone remained the Great and Illuſtrious Name of <hi>Montmorency:</hi> That the high Merits of his Anceſtours, whoſe long Scries ſpread as far as the beginning of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, did call more loudly for His Grace, than his raſhneſs did for the Severity of the King's Juſtice: That if he was ſo happy as to obtain a Second Life for his Friend, he would be his Security, that it ſhould be wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Service of His Majeſty; and that his blood ſhould onely ſerve to blot out both the Blackneſs and the Memory of his Crime.</p>

He anſwered, That there was no Pardon, and that he muſt die; that no body ought to be ſorry to ſee a Man put to death, who had ſo much deſerved it; and that he onely ought to be lamented for falling into ſo great a misfortune. The onely Favour which the King granted him, was, That the Hangman ſhould not Tie him; that his Eſtate ſhould not be Confiſcated; and that he ſhould be Executed in the Court of the Town-Hall. His Head was Cut off the ſame day that his Sentence was pronounced to him; after which the King prepared to take his Journey to <hi>Paris.</hi> 'Twas wondred at, that this Prince, who always yielded to the firſt Accuſation which the Cardinal made againſt any whom he deſired to ruine, had they done never ſo great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the State, ſhould remain inflexible to all the Sollicitations of the whole Court, and of all <hi>France,</hi> in an occaſion, when by ſaving the laſt off-ſpring of the moſt Illuſtrious Race of His Kingdom, this ſingle act of Clemency would have infinitely more turned to His Honour, than Severity.

'Twas believed that this Prelate had a deſign to poſſeſs himſelf of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Metz,</hi> and of ſome rich Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys in that City, and to ſet off this with the Title of the Governour of the City and Country about <hi>Metz,</hi> as well as the Cities and Citadels of <hi>Thoul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> in order to ſecure himſelf of a ſecure retreat on that ſide, in caſe of neceſſity.</p>

As ſoon as her Majeſty arrived, the Duke received her, and waited on her to her Apartment, thinking there was a Coach left for the Cardinal; but it ſeems his Orders were ill executed, and indeed there were but Coaches juſt enough for the Queen's Retinue. In the mean time the Cardinal paſſed the River, and finding ne'er a Coach there to receive him, walk'd a foot towards the Duke's Houſe, and was got half the way thither, when the Duke, after he paid his firſt Devoirs to the Queen at his own Houſe, ran to meet him. He made him a thouſand Excuſes, aſſuring him he had given Orders for a Coach to be left for him at the River-ſide, but that his Commands had not been obſerved.

                  </note> All the while her Majeſty continued at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ordered his Guards, whom he kept in Quality of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Province, to leave off their Liveries and Muſquets, and laid aſide all the Functions and Marks of his Office; but as ſoon as the Queen was gone, he thought there lay no Obligation upon him to ſhew the Cardinal that reſpect which was only due to a Soveraign. Thus going to make this Miniſter a Viſit, who was now on the mending hand, he came, accompanied as far as the Gate of his Lodgings by his Guards, with their Coats and Muſquets. The Cardinal's People, who were uſed to make others tremble, run to their Arms, while the Duke enter'd, and without taking the leaſt notice of the Diſorder he ſaw, was got to his Anti-Chamber, where he enquired after his Health. The Cardinal ſent him Word that he was ſtill ſo indiſpoſed, that he begg'd his Excuſe if he could not ſee him. After this the Duke ſtill
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54967:26"/>obſerved this Cuſtom; and when the Cardinal parted for <hi>Brouage,</hi> he went to accompany him to his Boat, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Guards, and ſeveral of the Nobility of that Province, as it were to ſhew him the greater Honour. However, the Cardinal was afterwards made to believe, that the Duke had ſome Deſign upon his Perſon, and 'tis credibly reported, that ever ſince that time, this Miniſter was not thought to be ſafe enough at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But if the Duke had deſign'd any thing of that nature, he might eaſily have accompliſh'd it, being much ſtronger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better beloved at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> than the Cardinal was; and beſides, the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who was the Duke's Son, never quitted this Miniſter, during the whole time of his Illneſs.</p>
               <p>While the Cardinal was in the height of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he ordered the Commandeur <hi>de la Porte</hi> his Unkle, and the Marquiſs <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> his Couſin to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Queen; who gave her a Magnificent Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Caſtle of <hi>Richlieu</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had lately built, and had made a very pleaſant place. He was not fully recovered, when he cauſed himſelf to be carried to <hi>Blaye,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> where he was intirely reſtored to his health. After this, he returned without farther delay to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the King went as far as <hi>Rochefort</hi> to meet him, which ſtands within Ten Leagues of that City.</p>

The King being informed that they were in Priſon, ſent Orders to have them immediately Tryed. and Writ a very obliging Letter to Madam <hi>de Combalet,</hi> wherein he told her, That he cou'd never have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſince he had given Peace to His Kingdom, by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54967:27"/>the Force of his Arms, and brought the Rebels to due Puniſhment, there had been any ſo bold and adventurous as to attempt ſuch an Enterprize; But that ſince ſome diſaffected Perſons ſtill ſought new occaſions to embroil the Nation, he wou'd immediately come to <hi>Paris</hi> to ſet all things in order. He alſo Congratulated her good Fortune, that ſhe had ſo happily eſcaped the Snare that was laid for her; and added, That if ſhe had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he wou'd have gone in Perſon with an Army of Fifty thouſand Men into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to ſet her at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again.</p>
               <p>This Lady had lived, till the above-mention'd Affair came to be diſcover'd, in an Hôtel which joyned to <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi>-Houſe, and which the Queen-Mother had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon the Cardinal when he was in her Favour, upon condition that ſhe might take it into her own hands again whenever ſhe pleas'd, paying down the Sum of Thirty thouſand Livres. When ſhe came to fall out with this Prelate, ſhe demanded to have this Hôtel ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to her; and having ſent for the Contract, ſhe found, that inſtead of ſo many <hi>Livres,</hi> it was <hi>Crowns;</hi> and that inſtead of <hi>whenever ſhe pleaſed,</hi> it was, <hi>when the King commanded it.</hi> The Queen proteſted, That ſhe never meant to make any ſuch Articles as theſe, and charged the Cardinal with Forgery. She Addreſſed her ſelf to the King, to oblige him to deliver it up; but His Majeſty, the more to Mortifie her, wou'd have the Cardinal ſtill keep in Poſſeſſion. This ill uſage vexed this Princeſs extreamly: but ſhe had farther occaſion to complain, when being out of <hi>France</hi> ſhe was inform'd, that <hi>Combalet</hi> lived there, and daily receiv'd Viſits from Perſons of the Firſt Quality, who made their Court to her Unkle by going to ſee her. Beſides this, ſhe made ſeveral new alterations in the Houſe for her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; and, for this purpoſe, without any more adoe, cauſed part of the Wall belonging to the Palace of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg</hi> to be beaten down. 'Tis believ'd that it was partly occaſion'd by this, that the Queen fell upon the deſign, to have <hi>Combalet</hi> ſtollen away, although there is no queſtion, but that ſhe made theſe Alterations by her Unkle's Orders, not being naturally of ſo haughty a humour, as to diſoblige the Queen-Mother in ſo high
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54967:27"/>a point as this was, of her own head. However, when this Deſign was diſcover'd, ſhe thought her ſelf no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſafe in this Houſe, and went to live at her Unkle's Palace, where ſhe ſeldom ſtirr'd out of doors.</p>

                  <hi>Monſieur</hi> having receiv'd the News of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s Death, whoſe Life he perſwaded himſelf they wou'd have ſav'd, thought that he ſhould be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly Diſgrac'd, and that no body for the future wou'd expoſe themſelves to the Miniſter's Indignation for his ſake, if he did not expreſs ſome reſentment for ſo notorious an Affront. It was confidently reported, that part of his Domeſticks wou'd be removed, and that ſome of them ſhould be declar'd not to be of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in order to puniſh them, as being excluded out of the Treaty which had been concluded with him. This made him interpret the Beheading of the Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> to be an Infraction of this Treaty, which he ſaid, He Sign'd onely out of a ſuppoſition that they wou'd give that Nobleman his Life.

As for the Queen-Mother, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of changing the Air, ſhe went to <hi>Malines</hi> the day before his arrival, being diſpleaſed with him, becauſe in the Treaty of <hi>Beſiers</hi> he was ſo far from ſupporting her intereſt, that he did not ſo much as make any mention of her.

The reaſon of which was, that this good Father cou'd not endure that <hi>Puilau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> who had an abſolute Aſcendant over Monſieur, ſhou'd equal him, and he, for his part, was not of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to truckle to any one, and had, in his time, refuſed to be over-ruled by ſome People that were infinitely more conſiderable than Father <hi>Chanteloube.</hi> This inflexible temper on both ſides brought them to an open defiance of one another, and this cauſed them to ſow that diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection between the Mother and the Son, which gave the Cardinal an opportunity to ruine all their Deſigns with much more eaſe, than if they had been better uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54967:29"/>as they were now contemptible. That on the other ſide, if they began the War, all the World wou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, they did it voluntarily, and of their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although they were really drawn into it by mere neceſſity: That the zealous, who are generally very indiſcreet, wou'd cry out, That this War was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the Deſtruction of the Catholick Religion; that His Majeſty therefore ought maturely to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate what Meaſures He was to take in this juncture, before he engaged Himſelf too far.</q>

               <p>The Cardinal added, That nevertheleſs, if the Queen once ſet foot in <hi>England,</hi> ſhe wou'd not eaſily leave it. He wou'd not explain himſelf any farther, thinking it ſufficient, that he had made an Overture which the Grand-Duke might make the beſt uſe of in time of neceſſity. He was reſolved to come to no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Accommodation with her, till he had effectually humbled her, and conſtrain'd her to do what he pleas'd. At preſent the onely trial of Skill was, to oblige her to depart out of the Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make her go to <hi>Florence,</hi> that ſo ſhe might not prove an obſtacle to any Treaty that they might make with <hi>Spain,</hi> according as an occaſion ſhould preſent it ſelf. While ſhe and Monſieur were in their Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54967:31"/>it wou'd be impoſſible to make a Treaty without comprehending them in it; and the Cardinal pretended that they ſhould leave all to His Majeſty's good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and give their conſent for him to Puniſh thoſe that had followed them. Thus all endeavours were uſed to make them quit the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was come back from <hi>Bruges,</hi> and the King ſent him into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to oblige the Parliament of <hi>Dijon</hi> to haſten the Trials of the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf, Puilaurens, Coudray Montpenſier,</hi> and the other Domeſticks of the Duke.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54967:31"/>an extraordinary ſtratagem, to diſcover, whether he was concern'd in this Affair or no.

He imagin'd that <hi>Saludie</hi> and <hi>Buſſe-Lamet,</hi> to whom the Pacquet was directed, had Orders to Apprehend him. But diſcovering at laſt that his fear had been in vain, he ſent a Gentleman four days after to the King and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to beg their Pardon for going away ſo abruptly, and ingenuouſly to confeſs, how he had been impoſed upon by his Fear.

               </p>
               <p>The King came to <hi>Paris</hi> on the 11th of <hi>April,</hi> and went next morning to the Parliament, to ſuppreſs the Office of Preſident which <hi>Coigneux</hi> had, and that of Counſellour, enjoy'd by <hi>Payen,</hi> Chief: Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Queen-Mother, whom he afterwards reſtor'd in Compliment to the Two Maſters of Accounts, whom the Cardinal favour'd exceedingly. Nevertheleſs the Law concerning Five years, which are allowed to thoſe that were Condemned for Contumacy, was ſuffer'd to ſtay in full force, in reſpect of others, becauſe it wou'd have given them too much trouble to make any Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it. The King Cenſur'd the Company very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely for preſuming to ſend their Deputies a few days before to S. <hi>Germans,</hi> to deſire him to re-call the Preſident <hi>de Memes,</hi> whom the Cardinal had Baniſhed. The King told them, That he wou'd take care to Chaſtiſe thoſe that refuſed to obey him, and that if the Parliament wou'd not ſuffer the Magiſtrates that were ſubordinate to it to be remiſs in the execution of its Orders, it was not juſt that a Soveraign ſhould bear the diſobedience of His Subjects: He added, That he wou'd be obey'd that very inſtant; and that for the future when he came to the Parliament, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Four Preſidents ſhould come and receive him upon their knees without the door of the Chamber, as the Cuſtom had been formerly. As for the Preſident <hi>de Memes,</hi> inſtead of being ſet at liberty, and called home, he was Impriſon'd in the Cittadel of <hi>Angers.</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:54967:32"/>Thus the King hindred them from making any Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances to him, upon any occaſion whatever, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Reign more Abſolutely than any of His Pedeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, he reſigned himſelf entirely to all the Paſſions of his Miniſter, though they were never ſo unjuſt; ſo that it was not poſſible to open his eyes, and undeceive him.</p>

               <p>The Cardinal told the King in Council, <q>That <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 4th wou'd never have let ſlip ſuch an occaſion, but that regard muſt be had to the time: That the King was without Children, and that Monſieur the Preſumptive Heir of the Crown, was in <hi>Flanders</hi> with the Queen-Mother: That the King's Conſtitution was not ſtrong enough to engage him in a War, which wou'd exceedingly fatigue both his Body and Mind: That, upon this occaſion, the Court muſt of neceſſity be at a great diſtance from <hi>Paris:</hi> That the King's Exchequer was exhauſted: That the zealous Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks wou'd exclaim more than ever, that this War was carried on to favour the Hereticks: That they wou'd be obliged at the ſame time to keep up Conſiderable Armies in <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe there was good reaſon to diſtruſt the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Lorrain:</hi> That it was the Genius of the <hi>French</hi> Nation to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually weary of War and Peace: That if the King was once engaged in a War, the Governours of the Provinces wou'd more eaſily declare for the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> That the leaſt ill ſucceſs, as the loſs of a Town, or a Battel, wou'd be enough to cauſe terrible Convulſions in the State: That in caſe His Majeſty happen'd to fall ſick, his Servants wou'd be loſt to all intents; and therefore though it was probable that ſome Advantages were to be got by a Rupture with <hi>Spain,</hi> yet it wou'd be better to live in Peace, and be content with aſſiſting their Enemies, that ſo they might not have them upon their hands: That the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54967:33"/>Money which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> demanded, to continue the War againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was ready, ſo that now nothing remain'd to doe, but onely to take care to execute the Project they had propos'd, which was, that if the King wou'd ſend Six thouſand Foot, and Six hundred Horſe before <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> they wou'd ſend their Army and Fleet to Attack that place, as alſo to take <hi>Graveline,</hi> which they offered to deliver up to <hi>France:</hi> That nevertheleſs great care was to be taken leaſt theſe Troops ſhould occaſion an open Rupture, and for that Reaſon it wou'd be better to ſend them by Sea, than by Land.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Baron <hi>de Charnace,</hi> Ambaſſadour to the <hi>States-General,</hi> offer'd them the Troops above-mention'd, and the Continuation of a Million of Livres for a year. The <hi>States</hi> made ſome difficulty at firſt to accept of theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; but not being able to adjuſt Affairs with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> they grew weary of ſo tedious and tireſome a Negotiation. They gave certain Articles in Writing, to which they demanded to have an Anſwer in Fifteen days; and if this were not done, they declared they wou'd hear no mention of a Truce. Upon this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of <hi>Spain</hi> deſiring a longer time, the <hi>States</hi> rather choſe to receive two thirds of a Million in ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which <hi>Charnace</hi> offer'd them, than to wait any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the uncertain Reſolutions of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army took the Field, and began the War afreſh by the taking of <hi>Rimberg,</hi> which Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on the 4th of <hi>June.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> diſcover'd the Conſpiracy that had been agitated by ſome of the Nobility in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who kept a ſecret Correſpondence with the <hi>French,</hi> and by making Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſome, kept the reſt in their Duty.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>France</hi> (properly ſpeaking) was neither in Peace, nor Open War with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the Two Crowns were inclin'd to follow that ſide which carried the greateſt Advantages with it.

                  <hi>Spain</hi> went every day worſe and worſe.

The <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretended, that the <hi>French,</hi> in caſe they deſign'd to obſerve the Treatics of <hi>Queraſque</hi> and <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> ought to deliver up <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi> to abandon <hi>Caſal,</hi> and the Paſſes of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> to draw their Garriſons out of <hi>Treves,</hi> and other places, which they held in that Archbiſhoprick; to reſtore thoſe which they had taken from the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and to meddle no more with the Affairs of the Empire. To this the <hi>French</hi> Anſwer'd, That they were ready to recall the Troops they had in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and in the Country of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> ſo ſoon as they were ſecured that the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> wou'd not think any more either of ſeizing <hi>Cazal,</hi> or the Paſſes of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line:</hi> That as for <hi>Pignerol,</hi> they had immediately put

               <p>Theſe were the Reaſons which the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> made uſe of to juſtifie the King's Conduct in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; and, in the mean time, they forgot nothing which might irritate the Enemies of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> againſt her.

                  <hi>Chateau-Thierry;</hi> where, on the very Night of his arrival he waited upon the King and Queen. Next day the Cardinal-Duke made him a Viſit, and gave him abundance of civil words, but very ſmall hopes as to the Affairs of the Duke his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It was to no purpoſe that the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> repreſented to him, That this Prince had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to keep the Treaty of <hi>Liverdun,</hi> and as little did it ſignifie to excuſe the Infractions they reproached him with. The Miniſter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. anſwer'd, <q>That they were heartily ſorry to find that the Effects did not agree with his Promiſes, and that the King being now upon a Journey, was not in a condition to hear any Talk of Buſineſs: That in a few days His Majeſty wou'd arrive at <hi>Bar,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might inform him nearer at hand, which of the two ways, either that of Gentleneſs, or that of Force he wou'd have employ'd againſt him, that they might be ſecure of him for the future.</q> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> proteſted, that the Duke was ready to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render all the Places he held in <hi>Alſatia</hi> to the King; but this was not ſufficient: and, to ſatisfie them that he wou'd break his Word no more with them, it was propos'd, That a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon ſhou'd be left in <hi>Nancy,</hi> the moſt conſiderable Place in all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nay, the Cardinal his Brother offer'd to conſent to the diſſolution of the Marriage between his Siſter
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54967:36"/>and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and begg'd pardon for it. But the Cardinal-Duke told him, <q>That this Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not equal the Injury that had been done to the King, and that His Majeſty found himſelf oblig'd to put the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> out of a condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe than his Word for the future; that for this end it was neceſſary the King ſhou'd have <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> by way of Caution, which the Duke ſhould forfeit for ever, that very moment he attempted any thing againſt <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> reply'd; That this was all one as to propoſe to his Brother to loſe the remainder of his Dominions, becauſe ſuch ſort of Pawns are very rarely Deliver'd: That it wou'd be too mean-ſpirited a condeſcenſion in a Prince to ſtoop ſo low as voluntarily to ſtrip himſelf of his Territories in the way of Negotiation; that it was too ſevere a Mortification to loſe ones Honour and ones Country at the ſame time; and that let the War ſucceed never ſo ill, it was impoſſible for him to be a greater Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: That <hi>Lorrain</hi> was the Half-way-Houſe between <hi>France</hi> and the States of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and that the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> were conſequently obliged in point of Intereſt, to preſerve an Amity both with one and the other: That this caution which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, wou'd ſo highly provoke the Emperour, upon whom the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain</hi> depended, that he wou'd confiſcate it, and put it under the Imperial Ban, which might happen at a juncture, when the King of <hi>France</hi> being employ'd elſewhere, wou'd not be in a condition to ſupport him.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons, however ſpecious they were, made no Impreſſion upon the Cardinal-Duke, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ruine the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> And ſo the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went, in all haſt, the very ſame day, to carry this ill News to his Brother, and the King advanced with his Forces as he had given this Prince to underſtand. In the mean time the Cardinal-Duke adviſed the King not to loſe this Opportunity of Conquering <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in caſe the Duke made the leaſt difficulty to deliver up thoſe places which they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Cardinal arrived with the King at St. <hi>Dizier</hi> the 23d of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Champagne,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:54967:36"/>where the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſent him word, That if he wou'd give him his Niece <hi>Combalet</hi> in Marriage, his Brother and he wou'd conſent to leave <hi>Nancy</hi> in the King's hand, becauſe they ſhould be then ſecure of its Reſtitution. Whether the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> thought that this was onely a pretence, or that he had ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon not to give his Aſſent to this Propoſal; he thanked the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for the great honour he did him; and made Anſwer, <q>That he ſhould be ſorry to have the World believe, that he had made the King go into <hi>Lorrain</hi> for his particular intereſt, as it wou'd be apt to believe, if he accepted the Honour which they did his Neice: That the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> ought, before all things, to give the King ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and, after that, His Majeſty wou'd ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Marriage wou'd be advantageous for His Service, and take his Meaſures accordingly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this juncture, the Cardinal-Duke repreſented to the King, <q>That if he did not ſuddenly ſurprize the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> there wou'd be no likelihood of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing him in a long time: That <hi>Nancy</hi> was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable place, regularly Fortifi'd, and not to be taken by force this Campagne: That it wou'd take up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight Months to reduce it by a Blockade, and that abundance of things might happen in that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val: That a Peace might be made in <hi>Germany,</hi> and a Truce in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that if it were ſo, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> wou'd be in a condition to make a powerful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: That, to Block up <hi>Nancy,</hi> it wou'd require Twenty thouſand Foot, and Three thouſand Horſe; beſides that there muſt be a ſmall Army to attend the King's Perſon, which wou'd demand a prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: That, on the other hand, to ſuffer tamely an Affront in State-matters, was the ready way to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a greater: That Money was of no uſe to His Majeſty, if he did not employ it for his Neceſſities; that is to ſay, to ſupport his Reputation, or to enlarge his Dominions: That a Million of Gold was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bear the extraordinary Expences of this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: That he cou'd never expect a fairer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and that the War, which raged in all p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54967:37"/>total ruine of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> eſpecially ſince in all appearance it ſeemed to be long-lived: That the Affairs of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were not any more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Truce: That all great Enterpriſes have their Difficulties; but that this was attended with very few, the Duke not being able to make head with his Forces againſt thoſe of His Majeſty; and the Allies were ſo much buſied for themſelves, that they cou'd not come to his Relief: That the Duke wou'd be always in the ſame mind he was then, that is, devoted to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> from which no conſiderations cou'd diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him, and that he onely wanted an opportunity to joyn with it to the detriment of <hi>France:</hi> That if the Duke was not ruin'd, the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> wou'd infallibly hold good, which wou'd be the occaſion of an everlaſting War. That a Man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be upon his Guard, to protect himſelf not onely from open violence, but from the ſecret practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of others: That on the other hand, if the Duke was once ruin'd, the Marriage of <hi>Monſieur</hi> wou'd break of courſe; and that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had told the Abbot of <hi>Elbene,</hi> That he ſhould not be ſorry to ſee him reduced to ſuch a paſs: That <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was too much an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant to his Intereſt, and <hi>Monſieur</hi> had too little Reſolution to ſtick to a Woman, by whom he ſhould gain no advantage, and who beſides wou'd be a charge to him: That by this means <hi>Monſieur</hi> wou'd be brought to a neceſſity to find out a way to get himſelf reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the King, by offering to take another Wife; whereas ſo long as the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſubſiſted, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> wou'd never think of an Accommodation. That <hi>Nancy</hi> was the beſt Rampart which <hi>France</hi> cou'd oppoſe on that ſide to the Attempts of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and that ſhe wou'd be deliver'd from all that ſhe had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to apprehend from the Implacable hatred of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> by taking this place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The King reliſhing the Cardinal's Reaſons for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> advanced as far as <hi>Bar,</hi> where he left the Queen, and the other Ladies of the Court. From thence he Marched to <hi>Pont-a-Mouſſon,</hi> where he arrived on the 28th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> In this Interval the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Florenville,</hi> which wou'd have thrown it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54967:37"/>to <hi>Nancy,</hi> was defeated by the Marquiſs <hi>de S. Chamond,</hi> whom the King ſent before, with part of the Army, to Block up that place. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> alſo came to <hi>Pont-a-Mouſſon,</hi> where he offer'd the King to put into his hands for Security, <hi>Saverne, Dachſtein,</hi> and <hi>la Mothe,</hi> with the Perſon of the Princeſs <hi>Margaret.</hi> The King accepted the latter; but, inſtead of the Places that were offer'd him, he ſtill demanded <hi>Nancy,</hi> which was infinitely of greater importance.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> told <hi>Richlieu,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was ſo unfortunate, that he cou'd not engage His Majeſty to repoſe any confidence in him, he was reſolv'd to Reſign his Dominions to him the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in caſe the King approved of it. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> Anſwer'd, <q>That he did not believe the King wou'd oppoſe this Reſignation, if the Duke was fully reſolved to put it in Execution; and, that he, for his part, had reaſon to wiſh it might be ſo, his paſt-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct giving them hopes that he wou'd be better affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>France;</hi> but, the Miſchief on't was, that this remedy was uneffectual, becauſe as the Duke was of a wavering and fickle temper, he might take a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to reaſume his Dominions, which wou'd be an eaſie matter for him to effect by recovering <hi>Nancy,</hi> at a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture when the King happened to be employ'd elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> found by this, that it was not poſſible to ſave <hi>Nancy.</hi> It was ſome time ago ſince he had demanded a Paſsport of the King to come and go, and fetch his Domeſticks and Equipage out of the City: The King had granted it him, and the Duke his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he having conſider'd, that the Princeſs <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> being the principal occaſion of the War, might be in danger, if <hi>Nancy</hi> was taken while he was there; they reſolved to contrive her eſcape out of the City, and afterwards out of <hi>Lerrain,</hi> to ſend her into <hi>Flanders</hi> to her Husband.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> got her diſguis'd in Man's Apparel, and carried her in his Coach out of the Town. At laſt an old Gentleman, and two Soldiers dreſt up like Lacqueys, conducted her through ſeveral Quarters of the Royal Army, without meeting any ſtop by the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54967:38"/>way; and after they had Travell'd a Dozen Leagues in the Night, they arriv'd by break of day at <hi>Thionville,</hi> a place belonging to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> From thence ſhe Writ to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> to the Queen-Mother, and to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> to demand a Guard, and an Equipage ſhe had occaſion for, to come to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> received this News with wonderful joy, and the Queen-Mother was no leſs pleas'd, although ſhe lived in no very good underſtanding with him, becauſe ſhe imagin'd that having a Daughter-in-Law wholly oppoſite to the Cardinal's Party, ſhe ſhould, at laſt, Triumph over all his Artifices. They ſent to this Princeſs all ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and <hi>Monſieur</hi> went to meet her as far as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King being at <hi>S. Nicholas,</hi> where he arrived tho 24th of that Month, received Advice, That the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> had made her eſcape into <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the manner as I have already related it. This News ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diſpleaſed him as well as the Cardinal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the conſequences which might attend the flight of this Princeſs, or becauſe it vexed them to be Tricked by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> in whoſe Integrity they had repoſed a Confidence. 'Tis true, S. <hi>Chamond</hi> had been ordered to examine all the Cardinal's Coaches, but that, wherein the Princeſs was, paſſed by one Morning before he was up, and was not at all Examin'd. The King being angry at this Trick that was play'd him, ſent Word to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> That ſince the Negotiation was broke, he deſign'd that the Paſsports he had given him ſhou'd be Revoked; and that if he tarried in the City, he muſt expect to be made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of War. However, the King gave him leave to come to <hi>Neufville;</hi> where the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to him, That he had contributed to his Siſter's Eſcape; but then he aſſured him, That ſhe was ſtill in the Dominions of the Duke his Brother, and that he might diſpoſe of her Perſon.</p>
               <p>Next day they learnt the quite contrary News, and <hi>Nancy</hi> being Inveſted on all ſides, they began to Work on the Lines of Circumvallation and Contravallation, becauſe they were afraid the Siege wou'd laſt a long while, and that the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> and <hi>Aldringuen</hi> wou'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54967:38"/>come to releve the place. But the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who was of a light and changeable diſpoſition, had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the Defence of this City, though the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or loſs of his Dominions abſolutely depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>Thus, after ſome Propoſals, to no purpoſe, the Cardinal his Brother was obliged to Sign a Treaty on the 6th of <hi>September,</hi> by which he promis'd to deliver <hi>Nancy</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three days into the King's hands, to keep ſuch a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon there as he ſhou'd think fitting, till ſuch time as his own good Behaviour, or the Peace of <hi>Germany</hi> ſhould convince His Majeſty, that he had nothing to apprehend on that ſide. He conſented beſides, That the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age age of the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> ſhould be declared null, in all the Forms, and that within Fifteen days ſhe ſhould be put into His Majeſty's hands, who had agreed, that ſhe ſhou'd tarry at <hi>Nancy,</hi> that he might inform himſelf upon the place, of all the Circumſtances of her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> deſir'd permiſſion of the King, to goe and find out the Duke his Brother, that he might Ratifie this Treaty. In the mean time the King took <hi>Charmes,</hi> and the Duke retired to <hi>Remire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> from which place he ſent his Brother back again to the King, to endeavour to gain as much time as he cou'd. But the Succours he expected not coming, he had a mind to go and Treat in Perſon with the King, an Indiſcretion ſcarce to be parallel'd in Hiſtory. To this end having demanded a Paſsport, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately granted him, he arrived at <hi>Charmes</hi> on the 18th of <hi>September</hi> with 800 Horſe. There he Negotiated for the ſpace of Three days with the Cardinals of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> and <hi>Bich,</hi> who manag'd him ſo dexterouſly, that on the Third he Ratifi'd the Treaty in the form they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It was agreed that <hi>Nancy</hi> ſhould continue in the King's hands for Four years; however, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, That if the Duke deliver'd up the Princeſs <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> to the King in Three Months, and conſented that her Marriage was Null from that very moment; and beſides, if he obſerved the reſt of the Treaty, which confirmed that of <hi>Vic,</hi> the King ſhould then ſurrender <hi>Nancy,</hi> without farther delay, after he had demoliſh'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54967:39"/>the Fortifications of the place, if he ſhould ſo think fit. The Duke promis'd that he wou'd do all that lay in his power to get his Siſter out of <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s hands, and deliver her to the King.</p>

Thus although he Writ to have the Gates open'd to the King's People, yet ſince the Mark was not in the Letter, the Governour refus'd to obey. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal who was more cunning than he, had, at firſt, ſome Suſpicion of him, that he deſign'd to withdraw; and, under a pretence of Treating him like a Great Prince, the King ſet his own Guards upon the Houſe where he Lodg'd.</p>
               <p>The Duke was ſenſible of it; and they made no difficulty to tell him the Reaſon of it; ſo that having no hopes to eſcape, he Writ to <hi>Nancy,</hi> and ſent the Mark in the Letter. The King's Garriſon enter'd the Town on the 24th of <hi>September,</hi> ſeized all the conſiderable Poſts, built a ſort of a Fort upon the Baſtions of the old City, and diſarm'd the Inhabitants, who were too well-affected to the Duke. It was of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the King to have <hi>Nancy</hi> in his hands, as to the Affairs of <hi>Germany;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by this Surrendry to comply for the future with whatever <hi>France</hi> Propoſed.</p>
               <p>While the Cardinal-Duke ſtay'd at <hi>Charmes,</hi> he was deſirous to ſee, whether the offer which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had made him about Marrying his Neice, was ſincere. For this end he ſhow'd extraordinary Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>Chamvallon,</hi> who had appear'd very zealous to have the Match concluded, that ſo he might engage him to reaſſume this Negotiation. As the Prince of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> when he threw up his Cardinal's-Cap, wou'd be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe oblig'd to reſign all the Eccleſiaſtical Benefices he poſſeſs'd; ſo it was convenient on the other ſide, that he ſhould have an Eſtate ſufficient to ſupport his Dignity.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54967:39"/>The Cardinal-Duke promis'd to give his Neice a vaſt Portion, and to make her his Heir of the greateſt part of his Wealth; and therefore he expected that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſhou'd ſettle upon his Brother Land, to the value of a Hundred thouſand Crowns a year, that ſo he might be enabled to bear the Title of Duke, which, together with the above-mention'd Revenue, ſhou'd deſcend to the Iſſue of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> even though the Duke ſhou'd happen to have Children. If the Duke wou'd conſent to this, the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> oblig'd himſelf to employ all his Intereſt with the King, to get the Dutchy of <hi>Bar</hi> ſurrendred to him, for which he ſhou'd do homage, not in the Name of his Wife, as it had been pretended, but as Rightful Heir; however, with this proviſo, that he ſhou'd immediately after ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up this Dutchy to his Brother; that he ſhou'd aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign him the Hundred thouſand Crowns upon its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancies; and that in caſe it was not enough to make up that Sum, he ſhou'd annex ſome Neighbouring-Lands: as on the other hand, if it was more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the over-plus ſhou'd belong to him. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal wou'd not ſpeak to the King about this Affair himſelf, but he got it to be propoſed by the other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, and its probable it had ſucceeded, if the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> cou'd have been prevail'd upon to cut off ſo conſiderable a part of his Dominions, as that was, which they demanded of him. But ſo ſoon as the King had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Nancy,</hi> and re-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the way to <hi>Paris,</hi> this Negotiation was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54967:40"/>that reſpect to her in appearance, which he cou'd not in honour omit. This gave occaſion to the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Write to the King, and ſpeak of a Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as ſhe was ſo far from adjuſting matters with the Cardinal, that ſhe hardly ever mention'd him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Injurious Language, there were ſmall hopes that ſhe ſhould ſee her Son again.</p>

But as it was Scandalous to keep this Princeſs ſo long out of the Kingdom, and the King ſometimes ſelt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe upon that ſcore, the Cardinal told him, That he ought not onely to remember, that he was a Son, but alſo that he was a King, and that he lay under greater obligations to procure the repoſe and tranquility of his Kingdom, than to ſatisfie the Paſſions of the Queen His Mother. By this Maxim which took it for granted, that the Wellfare of the State was incompatible with ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the demands of <hi>Maria de Medicis,</hi> he hindred the King from ſuffering himſelf to be touched by thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which Nature implants in all Children towards their Parents.</p>

               <p>The King Anſwer'd, That he was extreamly ſorry at the Ill Treatment the Queen His Mother received from the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> but that ſhe had never fallen into theſe Inconveniences if ſhe had followed his good
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54967:41"/>Advice, and that of her moſt faithful Servants: That he formerly believed that ſhe had a Kindneſs for him, but that ſince ſhe had diſcover'd ſo much Ill-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he cou'd hardly perſwade himſelf that ſhe had really that Affection for him as ſhe pretended: That he knew well enough how far ſhe was concern'd in the Affair of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſince ſhe had Pawn'd her Jewels to furniſh the Rebels with Arms: That it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him to ſee there was no Security for Him in <hi>France,</hi> if his Mother returned thither, ſince thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Perſons, that were about her, began to Cabal more than ever.</p>
               <p>At laſt he enquired of <hi>Villiers,</hi> If he had any Orders to ſee the Cardinal? <hi>Villiers</hi> anſwer'd, No: but ſaid, That if he met him, he wou'd not fail to pay his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to him, although the Queen was ſtill incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The King reply'd, That if it was true that this Princeſs loved her Eldeſt Son, as ſhe ſaid ſhe did, ſhe wou'd likewiſe love the Cardinal for the ſignal Services he had done the Crown ſince the Reduction of <hi>Rochelle;</hi> but that ſo long as ſhe kept ſuch People as <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> and Madam <hi>du Fargis</hi> about her, it was to no purpoſe to expect any Reconciliation. Upon this <hi>Villiers</hi> ſaid, That the Queen knew <hi>du Targis</hi> for what ſhe was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable: and the King anſwer'd, That ſhe was one of thoſe Vipers of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who, together with the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde, Marillac</hi> the Keeper of the Seals, and ſuch like bleſſed Inſtruments, had ſeduced the Queen-Mother into all theſe Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>It was diſcover'd by <hi>Villiers</hi>'s Diſcourſe, that the Q.

                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec. T. 7. p. 699.</note> However ſhe ſent to acquaint the King, in Anſwer to ſome Propoſals ſhe had receiv'd from <hi>France,</hi> That to let him ſee how well ſhe loved him, and to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate an acceſs for thoſe perſons whom ſhe wou'd ſend to him, ſhe was willing to forget all the ill Offices the Cardinal had done her, nay, even to have an Affection for him, in conſideration of His Majeſty: That neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54967:42"/>ſhe wou'd not be forced to part with the meaneſt Servant ſhe had, and much leſs with Father <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> who had faithfully ſerved her in things of the greateſt Importance, but that he wou'd quit her Service of his own accord, as ſoon as ever the King commanded him to do ſo: That if ſhe might be ſo happy as to procure an Accommodation, ſhe wou'd manage it by her ſelf, without appearing in the Affairs of Monſieur; and that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had told her, That ſhe might do ſo if ſhe pleas'd.</p>
               <p>The King, before he diſmiſs'd <hi>Villiers,</hi> told him, That he was heartily ſorry at the Vexations which the Queen his Mother had met in <hi>Flanders;</hi> but that if ſhe imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally examin'd her ſelf, ſhe wou'd ſoon find, that ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was the occaſion of them: That if ſhe wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver her Evil Counſellors up to him, in order to their Puniſhment, as they deſerv'd, and love the true Servants of the Crown, as ſhe was in duty oblig'd, then there wou'd be no room to ſuſpect that ſhe continued longer in the evil diſpoſition that poſſeſſed her when ſhe left <hi>France:</hi> That <hi>Chanteloube</hi> had Written, That ſhe wou'd never be reconcil'd; and, in one of his Letters (which had been ſent to the King) had made Merry with the Viſit which he (meaning <hi>Villiers</hi>) had made him; and that while the Queen encourag'd ſuch a notorious Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite as he was, it cou'd not be imagin'd that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were ſincere. All the King's Diſcourſes, as alſo thoſe of the Cardinal's Creatures, tended to the ſame purpoſe; which was, That the Queen-Mother ſhou'd abandon all her Domeſticks to the Indignation of the Miniſter, and receive others of his Nomination, before any thing was concluded: But they did not believe that this Princeſs, who was full as haughty and obſtinate as the Cardinal, wou'd ever make ſuch low condeſcenſions. If the King ſpoke ill of Father <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> the Queen was not behind-hand with him in railing at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal; and by the means of the Abbot of S. <hi>Germain</hi> her Secretary, ſhe publiſh'd every day bitter Satyrs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſeveral Volumes of which are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>

                     <hi>Siri,</hi> Ibid. P. 103.</note> The Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſhow'd a mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to come to a ſpeedy concluſion, becauſe the Intereſt of his Family requir'd it. He obtain'd permiſſion of the Unkle to viſit his Neice, whom he found to be extreamly agreeable; So that now nothing more was left to doe than to come to Conditions on both ſides. <hi>Richlieu</hi> poſitively ſtuck to it; That the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſhou'd have a Hundred thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum</hi> ſettled upon him; and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Articled, That in conſideration of this Marriage, they ſhou'd reſtore all the Places that had been taken from his Brother, and leave every thing in the ſame condition as they found it. The Houſe of <hi>Lorrain</hi> hoped by this Match to be able to engage the King to own the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Monſieur</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> as good and valid. But upon theſe Matters great difficulties aroſe on both ſides.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had an inexpreſſible averſion to <hi>France,</hi> and to the Cardinal, which was the reaſon why they treated him ſo ſeverely; and was not of a temper to embrace any Party, merely upon the account of its being the ſafeſt. He had likewiſe great Diſputes about the Confines of his Country with <hi>France,</hi> which did her ſelf Juſtice by force of Arms. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had been Promis'd long before to a Princeſs of his own Family, and Siſter to the Durcheſs; who, if the other March went forward, muſt be ſent to a Monaſtery. On the other ſide, it was not very reputable for the King, after he had been at ſo prodigious an Expence, and had made ſo great a buſtle, to ſurrender all back again to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> only in conſideration of making an Advantageous Marriage for the Neice of his Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. Beſides, the Cardinal had reaſon to fear, that the World wou'd ſurmiſe that he concluded his own Affairs at the King's Expence; and that His Majeſty wou'd entertain ſome jealous thoughts at his deſigning the Grandeur of his Family. The Marriage too of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was no ſmall obſtacle, ſince it was not probable, that they wou'd wholly reconcile themſelves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54967:43"/>to the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and, at the ſame time continue to carry on the total deſtruction of it.</p>
               <p>However, this Alliance ſeemed ſo advantageous to the Cardinal, that 'twas generally believ'd he deſir'd it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he anſwer'd the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> coldly enough, That his Neice was obſtinately reſolv'd to embrace a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life; and that it was not poſſible for him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Inclinations. But this was only an Artifice to ſecure himſelf the more of the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom he looked upon not to be ſo cordial in this Affair as he deſired, to endeavour, if he cou'd obtain of them, more Advantageous Conditions; but, above all, to ſee whether the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain</hi> wou'd yield to depoſite their beſt Places in the King's hands. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> perceiving <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s deſign, reſolved to uſe the ſame Policy, and ſeem'd to be indifferent on his ſide, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go to <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to know his final Reſolution there; though at the ſame time he did not diſcontinue to ſollicit this Affair privately at Court. If they came to a concluſion, he hoped, by that means, to procure bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conditions; and if the Negotiation happen'd to be wholly broke off, the Cardinal cou'd not complain of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which had done him the honour to ask his Neice in Marriage. As he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, the Cardinal-Duke ſent him word, That in a Months time he ſhou'd receive a Poſitive Anſwer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Madam <hi>de Combalet</hi> reſolved to Marry the ſecond time or no. All the World was ſenſible, that if her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle had thought it expedient for her to Marry again, and eſpecially one that was a Prince, ſhe wou'd never have wanted much entreaty; but the Reaſons above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd ſtood in the way, and hindred this Marriage from being concluded ſo haſtily. The Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The 20th of <hi>December.</hi>
                  </note> parted at laſt without coming to any determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to the Marriage: he onely carried to the Duke his Brother the Reſtitution of the Revenues of the Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> and a Prorogation of Two Months for him to do Homage to the King for them.</p>
               <p>All this while the Queen-Mother lived in no great amity with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> through the indiſcreet management of Father <hi>Chanteloube</hi> and <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> who, in ſtead of reconciling them, made the breach wider, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54967:43"/>ſet them at a greater diſtance. Thus the Mother and the Son, who were incapable of finding out of themſelves what was their true Intereſt, became the ſport of their Favourites, who engaged them in all their quarrels and caprices. But it happen'd unfortunately for the Queen-Mother and <hi>Gaſton,</hi> that the Perſons that manag'd them, fell infinitely ſhort of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Miniſter in Politicks, although perhaps they were not inferiour to him in Malice. The Queen-Mother who had conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Match of the Princeſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> prevail'd with her to perſwade her Husband to Diſcard <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> whom this Lady, for her part, did not love, becauſe he had talked of getting her Marriage diſſolved.

He told him, <q>That the Queen-Mother had appeared long ago ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the State: That before ſhe left <hi>France</hi> the King had offer'd her very reaſonable Terms of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, as Places, Governments, and ſo forth, by which ſhe might eaſily perceive, that he had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to uſe her with any Rigour: That nevertheleſs ſhe had fled to the declared Enemies of the Crown, which ſhe had never done, but out of a Principle of Revenge, and becauſe ſhe never deſign'd to come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort of Accommodation: That ſhe cou'd not be ignorant that her joyning with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> wou'd diſpleaſe the King, and that all good <hi>Frenchmen</hi> muſt blame her for having recourſe to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> That ſince ſhe had broke through all theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it was a ſure Indication, that ſhe had an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred to <hi>France:</hi> That her Actions notoriouſly contradicted her words, in which ſhe proteſted that ſhe had no deſign againſt the State, but that ſhe was full of Diſſimulation, as viſibly appear'd in the whole Conduct of her Life: That it wou'd be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the King to be Reconciled with her, and call her home; but that on the contrary, ſeveral great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences might happen upon it, becauſe it wou'd be then a harder matter to perſwade <hi>Monſieur</hi> to return: That her falling out with him and his Domeſticks,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54967:44"/>was the moſt forcible Reaſon that induced <hi>Puilaurens</hi> to adviſe his Maſter to avoid thoſe places, where he might find the ill effects of the Mortal hatred of that Princeſs, and therefore if ſhe came into <hi>France, Puilau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> wou'd have the leſs inclination to carry the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> thither: That, ſuppoſing <hi>Monſieur</hi> wou'd not, upon this, be unwilling to return, yet they were likely to gain nothing by his coming home, ſince it might eaſily ſo happen, that the Queen and he wou'd joyn afreſh together for the better execution of their wicked deſigns: That the King wou'd find it a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to Marry <hi>Monſieur</hi> again to whom he pleas'd, and principally to the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Conzaga,</hi> for whom the Queen-Mother had an invincible averſion: That the Tranquillity of the Kingdom wou'd be more endanger'd, ſince thoſe that had harbour'd any ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns wou'd certainly go and communicate them to the Queen-Mother, whom they knew to be of a reſolute and revengeful temper, whereas they durſt not repoſe any confidence in the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who was known to be inconſtant: That the King wou'd not have the ſame Peace of Mind, nor be in the ſame ſecurity as to his Perſon: That he wou'd not be obey'd ſo punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſince the ill-affected wou'd hope to be ſupported by the Queen-Mother: That the Lives of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Servants wou'd be in greater danger, becauſe it wou'd be an eaſier matter to deſtroy them near at hand, than afar off: That though the Queen-Mother and <hi>Monſieur</hi> were both of them to morrow in <hi>France,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſatisfy'd by the King, as to both their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and a Miſunderſtanding ſtill continu'd between them, it was certain that in three Months time they would be diſcontented, and wou'd as certainly reunite in their diſcontents; whereas if <hi>Monſieur</hi> was in the Kingdom, and the Queen out of it, it wou'd be difficult for them to maintain any great correſpondence together.</q>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54967:45"/>at leaſt out of the Kingdom: but as it wou'd have been too odious to publiſh to all the World, that her Son wou'd never be reconciled to her. The Council, in appearance, concluded the contrary; but, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, 'twas the ſame thing, becauſe they knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that this Princeſs wou'd not ſtoop ſo low as to do what they reſolved to demand of her. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretended, That if the Queen-Mother wou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince all People, that ſhe had no hand in the Aſſaſſinates, which ſome of her Servants had projected, by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authors of theſe Pernicious Counſels to Juſtice, the King wou'd give her leave to return into <hi>France,</hi> put her in full poſſeſſion of her Jointure, and permit her to live in any of her Houſes that were at a diſtance from the Court.</p>
               <p>As for what related to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the Cardinal obſerv'd, <q>That this Prince's Abſence was at preſent Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to His Majeſty; but that the longer he tarried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom he daily contracted a greater Friendſhip, the more it was to be feared, that he wou'd, one day, deſtroy in a moment, what had been doing for ſeveral years, with no little difficulty, for the welfare of the State: That however theſe ills were at a diſtance, whereas the Miſchief which he might occaſion, if he lived in <hi>France,</hi> and was ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to it, as he certainly was, wou'd be felt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That if <hi>Monſieur</hi> came back into <hi>France,</hi> upon thoſe Conditions the King had offer'd him, which, as they were honourable to himſelf, ſo they were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to <hi>France,</hi> his return wou'd be advantageous to the Kingdom; but that there was a great deal to fear, and but little to hope, if he came back upon thoſe Terms, which <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had inſiſted upon the laſt Summer, <hi>viz.</hi> the Government of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and <hi>Macon,</hi> to be the Reſidence of <hi>Monſieur</hi> and his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold; becauſe that then this Prince wou'd be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> an entrance at any time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom, who wou'd be glad of ſuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; That, if matters were ſo, they muſt lay aſide all thoughts of attacking any of their Neighbours, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enlarge the Kingdom, or to aſſiſt the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of the Crown, becauſe it was always to be fear'd,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54967:45"/>that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wou'd make ſome Irruption on that ſide; and, that though they did not break in upon them, yet they wou'd cauſe ſo many alarms there, that their hands wou'd be effectually tied up, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any juſt pretence to complain of them; That the diſaffected wou'd take freſh courage, and fall upon new deſigns.</q> In fine, the Cardinal concluded, that it wou'd be better to leave <hi>Monſieur</hi> where he was, than to receive him upon thoſe conditions which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>However, he at laſt propoſed, Whether one might not, in Juſtice and Equity, nay, with honour and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the State, Promiſe <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> that <hi>Monſieur</hi> and he ſhould reſide at <hi>Macon,</hi> in order to draw him into <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards ſend this latter to Priſon, in ſtead of keeping their word with him. As for the equity of the thing, the Cardinal was of opinion it cou'd never be queſtion'd, ſince <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had been engag'd in ſuch Miſchievous Deſigns againſt the State; but then he ſaid, His Majeſty's Honour wou'd receive an irreparable loſs, if he broke his Word upon this occaſion. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <q>That ſuch a procedure wou'd be ſo far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any ſervice, or helping to counter-balance the detriment which the King's Reputation muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuffer by breaking his Word, that it wou'd draw after it ſeveral fatal conſequences, ſince if <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was Impriſon'd, they wou'd be oblig'd to apprehend <hi>Monſieur,</hi> which was not practicable: That if this Prince came to leave the Kingdom afreſh, he wou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return, whatever Promiſes were made him, after he had been once deceiv'd: That then he wou'd reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite himſelf more firmly than ever with the Queen-Mother, from whom <hi>Puilaurens</hi> kept him at as great a diſtance as he cou'd; and that by her Inducements and Perſwaſions he wou'd become of an Irreconcilea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper: That if it was alledg'd, That upon the Impriſonment of <hi>Puilaurens, Monſieur</hi> muſt be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to keep within a certain place which ſhou'd be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him, and from which they ſhould take care that it wou'd not be poſſible for him to ſtir; beſides, that this was infinitely eaſier to be ſaid than done, they wou'd gain no advantage by it for the preſent, but run
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54967:46"/>the riſque of loſing all for the future: That at preſent the King deſir'd <hi>Monſieur</hi> to break off his Marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Marry the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua;</hi> yet if this Prince were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither one nor the other cou'd be done, ſince the World wou'd ſay with reaſon, That he was not free: That thus his Marriage with the former wou'd be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by it, in ſtead of being diſſolved: That for the future, thoſe that ſerved His Majeſty cou'd never hope to reconcile themſelves to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> from which no manner of good cou'd arrive to the Kingdom: That His Majeſty, to the great Misfortune of <hi>France,</hi> having been Married Eighteen years without any Children, thoſe Perſons that believed he would never have any Iſſue, would publickly exclaim, That the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had a mind to deſtroy the Preſumptive Heir of the Crown, which might occaſion ſeveral vexatious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</q> The Cardinal concluded to leave the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> where he was, if he would not return upon the Conditions the King had lately offered him, which were, to give him a conſiderable ſum of Money to pay his Debts, to re-eſtabliſh him in all his Appanages and Good, to give great Gratifications to <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the Government of <hi>Auvergne</hi> upon him, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to reſide there with his Guards. If <hi>Monſieur</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to come back upon theſe Conditions, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thought it would be the beſt way to let him tarry in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſince any other means of bringing him home were neither honourable nor advantageous.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conditions having been propoſed to the Queen-Mother, and to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> they equally rejected them: The Queen-Mother could never conſent to ſee her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants treated after a worſe manner than thoſe of her Son; and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> imagined that they would grant him more, if he refuſed theſe firſt offers. But the event ſhewed, that both of them were miſtaken, and that they had better have adjuſted matters in time, than ſtand out againſt a Party which was infinitely ſtronger than their own. And the Cardinal, by this means, arrived to the deſign he propoſed to himſelf, which was, to keep the Queen-Mother and <hi>Monſieur,</hi> but eſpecially the former, out of <hi>France,</hi> as long as he was able.</p>

His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Cardinal, endeavour'd to excuſe him, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He had done all that lay in his Power to get the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> out of the hands of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> but that this Prince would not part with her. He deſired the Cardinal-Duke to Intercede for him with the King, that his Citation might be Suſpended; and declared, That if they proceeded farther, his Brother would not make his Appearance, as being prejudicial to the Rights of a Soveraign Prince. <hi>Richlieu</hi> maintained, That as he was a Vaſſal of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> for the Dukedom of <hi>Bar,</hi> he was obliged to come in Perſon thither, which, if he neglected to doe, or was declared to be an Accomplice in the Rape, they ſhould be forced to proceed againſt him, by the ways of Fact. At the ſame time Orders were ſent to the Parliament of <hi>Metz,</hi> to Prohibit the Inhabitants of thoſe Places that had been lately taken from the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> as Dependencies upon the Biſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Thoul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> to own the Duke for their Lord, but onely the Biſhops of theſe Cities, and the King, to be as it were their Protector. They treated him after this manner, to conſtrain him to be ſincerely devoted to the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> and to come himſelf to <hi>Paris</hi> to adjuſt theſe Differencies, or to reduce him to ſuch a condition that he could do them no Injury.</p>
               <p>Thus they Mortified the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and now began to give New Vexations to the Queen-Mother, by ſtopping, and narrowly examining upon the Frontiers all the Carriages that came to her from <hi>France</hi> for her own uſe, and that of her Servants, though a Paſsport was allowed her. This Princeſs ſent Complaints of this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the King, and repreſented to him, That it was
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54967:47"/>to no purpoſe that the Cardinal employed theſe Rigours to bring her to his own Terms, and that ſhe would never humble her ſelf before him.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Attorney-General, following the Inſtructions of the Court, preſented a Requeſt to the Parliament, to declare, That the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had been Stollen out of <hi>France</hi> by the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and conſequently, that his Marriage was null and void. The Parliament demanded time to inform and deliberate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Affair of ſo great a Conſequence, but a very ſhort ſpace was allowed them; and the King came thither in Perſon on the 18th of <hi>January</hi> with the Cardinal, to get a Declaration confirmed, by which he reſtored the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to his Eſtate and Honour, provided, that in Three Months he acknowledged his Fault, and came to Reſide in <hi>France.</hi> He extended the ſame Favours to all his Domeſticks, except <hi>Coigneux, Monſigot, Vieville,</hi> and ſome others. The King alſo declar'd, that he could not approve of the Marriage of <hi>Menſieur</hi> for the Reaſons ſpecified in His Declaration; and ordered the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Judge of the Informations which had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to Juſtifie, that he had cauſed <hi>Monſiuer</hi> to be ſtollen, and conſequently to ſhow that his Marriage was null.</p>

               <p>The Parliament was not a little perplexed about <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi>'s Marriage, by reaſon of the ill Conſequences which the Judgment they gave might draw after it; ſince it concern'd the Heirs of a Prince who might one day ſit upon the Throne. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was generally blamed for giving his Conſent to this Match, which, as it diſpleaſed the Court, ſo it had plunged him in very mortifying Circumſtances. Otherwiſe this Marriage was neither too unequal, nor was it diſadvantageous to the State; and indeed, nothing could be found fault in it, but that it was done without the King's Approbation, who might at laſt approve of it, after he had teſtified his Diſlike of it, as in the Upſhot he was obliged to do. To revenge himſelf for this Affront, he demanded <hi>Zore</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which is a Place between <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Thionville,</hi> to Fortifie it. The Duke immediately granted it, becauſe he durſt not do otherwiſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the King promiſed to ſurrender it to him, not by Letters Patent, but by a private Letter of the Privy Seal, to denote the King's Superiority: He likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Duke, the original Contract of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and all the Papers he had in his hands relating to that Affair. He deſired to know who were the Witneſſes that had aſſiſted at the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Eſpouſals, and to have the Prieſt, who had officiated, deliver'd up to him. On the other hand, to make the Duke ſenſible that in caſe he would ſubmit himſelf he might expect a gentler Treatment, Orders were ſent to the Parliament of <hi>Metz</hi> to deferr the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition which they had been commanded to iſſue out to the Inhabitants of the Lands depending upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> not to own the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> any longer for their Prince; and they ſuffer'd him to gather his Revenues in the Dukedom of <hi>Bar,</hi> without preſſing him to come and do Homage for it.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54967:48"/>therefore, that he might be able to declare openly againſt her, without Danger of being deprived of the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Dominions, he made on the 19th of <hi>January</hi> a Donation of his Seats to his Brother <hi>Nicholas Francis,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> under a pretence that the Perſon of this latter was more agreeable to the King than his own. However, the World was ſenſible that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was only a Pretence, becauſe he performed ſeveral Acts of a Sovereign Prince after he had made it. When this was over, he retired with eight hundred Horſe and two thouſand Foot, and joyn'd the Imperial Army.</p>
               <p>The new Duke diſpatched <hi>Contriſſon</hi> immediately to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint the King and Cardinal with what had paſſed between his Brother and him, and to promiſe that he wou'd obſerve the Treaty of <hi>Charmes.</hi> As for his Brother, he aſſur'd them that he did not know whither he was gone: but this did not hinder the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from carrying on the Proceſs they had begun againſt him. The Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> told <hi>Contriſſon</hi> when he ſhew'd him the Surrendry which the Duke had made in favour of him, <q>That they had juſt Occaſion to complain of the Duke for two Reaſons: the firſt was, his Violation of the three ſeveral Treaties which he himſelf had concluded with the Duke; and the other was the Rape of the Duke, of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whom he had forced to marry his Siſter. For the firſt, the Duke's Dominions, in the Opinion of this Miniſter, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>France,</hi> and could not be reſtored to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> but upon the ſame Conditions by which his Brother held them: And as for the ſecond, the Duke was not excuſed from the Guilt of it by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelf. Beſides this, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was his Accomplice in the Matter, for he, as Biſhop of <hi>Thoul,</hi> had granted a Diſpenſation not publiſhing the Banns, as otherwiſe they ought to have done for the Marriage of <hi>Monſieur</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> and had authorized a Monk to ſay Maſs upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to the prejudice of the Curate, that this Affair might be kept the more ſecret.</q> The Cardinal Duke reproached him of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with having abuſed the King's Paſſport to further his Siſter's Eſcape out of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and to ſend her to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>

               <p>Thus the Princes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> found themſelves engaged in very great Perplexities, and were at a Loſs how to appeaſe <hi>France,</hi> or how to defend themſelves againſt her. Nothing, in all appearance, but the Match propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Cardinal's Neice, could accommodate theſe Differences: but ſeveral great Difficulties aroſe in that Affair, as I have already obſerved. On the other hand, it was to be feared, that if the Cardinal-Duke ſuſpected that they had asked his Neice in Marriage only to amuſe him, he would revenge the Affront in a cruel manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contriſſon</hi> was ſent back to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with Orders to tell him, that it was in his power to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Brother's Steps or not; but that if he deſired to live in peace, he muſt take different meaſures. He was demanded to explain himſelf upon this Head, and that he would diſcover by his manner of acting what were his true Sentiments. But above all, it was deſired of him that he wou'd diſapprove the Marriage of his Siſter, and deliver the Original Papers of the Contract, and the Diſpenſation for the Banns. They gave <hi>Contriſſon</hi> in Writing all that they required of his Maſter, and told him that they expected an Anſwer to each Article in Writing alſo.</p>
               <p>As the King neither liked nor diſliked the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Surrendry of his Dominions to his Brother, the latter took upon him the Title of <hi>Duke,</hi> and put himſelf in poſſeſſion of the State belonging to his Family, with the uſual Solemnities, that ſo he might convince the World there was no Colluſion in this Matter between his Brother and him. He had not as yet reſign'd his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Cap, and therefore ſtiled himſelf the <hi>Cardinal-Duke of Lorrain.</hi> Soon after, he ſent back <hi>Contriſſon</hi> to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> with an Anſwer to every Article in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; as alſo to demand <hi>Saverne,</hi> which the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force,</hi> without alledging any Reaſon for ſo doing, had taken from the Duke his Brother, when there was no War between his Majeſty and him; and to complain that the King's Officers who commanded in thoſe Places which his Majeſty held in Truſt, hinder'd the Duke's Commiſſaries from levying upon the Inhabitants of thoſe Cities the ordinary Taxes, and to demand farther time in regard of the Homage he was to do for the Dutchy of <hi>Bar.</hi>

                  </note> at <hi>Paris,</hi> acquitted himſelf the next Day of his Orders, and went to carry his Letters of Credence to the Cardinal. When he ſaw in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Letter, <hi>Cardinal-Duke of Lorrain,</hi> he ſaid that this was a pleaſant ſort of a Quality, by way of Contempt, as if the Title of Cardinal-Duke had only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Armand John du Pleſſis,</hi> excluſively of all others. After this he fell into an extraordinary Paſſion againſt the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and ſpoke of it in very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable Terms, as he was uſed to ſpeak of all thoſe that uſed the ſame Artifices againſt him which he employ'd againſt others. <hi>Contriſſon</hi> was ſo daunted, that he ſcarce knew what to anſwer; but at laſt he told him, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had examined the Houſes of all the Notaries of <hi>Nancy,</hi> as the Count <hi>de Braſſac,</hi> Governour in that City for the King, knew, they could not find any Minutes of the Contract of <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Marriage; and that in all probability there never were any, having perhaps been written by the hand of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> himſelf: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they find the Diſpenſation for the Banns, but that the Cardinal Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> offer'd to ſign one, in the ſame manner as the other had been: That they cou'd not tell the Names of the Witneſſes to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and that the Monk who had perform'd the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Eſpouſals, had left <hi>Lorrain.</hi> To this the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu</hi> replied, in a great paſſion, <q>That now it plainly appeared that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> (for he never vouchſafed to call him Duke) would follow the Footſteps of his Brother: That theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, full of Diſſimulation, and very different from what he had promis'd by word of mouth, did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſcover his Deſign, as they formerly found by what Spirit he acted, when after he had denyed that he knew any thing of his Siſter's Marriage, it was now diſcovered that he had granted a Diſpenſation for the Banns: That till then they had believed the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was a Prince of Honour and Sincerity, whereas they found him at preſent to be the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: That if he refuſed to ſend the Contract, it was a Matter of no great Importance, ſince they cou'd ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcover after what manner it was done: That if they ſtiſled the Original Papers, it would be ſo much
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54967:49"/>the eaſier to get the Marriage annull'd: That they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knew who were the Witneſſes, and that as for them and the Monk, who had diſappeared, the King would let them ſee, to their Coſt, that he had long Hands.</q> At laſt he concluded, That whereas he had been formerly a Friend to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> he wou'd be his greateſt Enemy if he continued to follow the Maxims of his Brother.</p>
               <p>As for what concerned the Taking of <hi>Saverne,</hi> the King, according to the Cardinal, was not obliged to make any Excuſes for what had been done upon very juſt Grounds: And he added, <q>That if the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had defended it, they wou'd have taken it away from him by force: That they wou'd conſider what was to be done to the Governours of thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which his Majeſty held in truſt, who had hinder'd the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> from raiſing his Duties: That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of allowing farther time for him to do Homage for the Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> he muſt expect every moment to ſee it declared lapſed to the King, by the Duke's Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and incorporated to the Crown, and that the Principal might well follow the Acceſſary.</q> His mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that they might juſtly enough ſeize upon all <hi>Lorrain</hi> by vertue of a Decree of Parliament which wou'd be inflicted upon the Duke by way of Puniſhment for his ſtealing away <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and for the Charges of War.</p>
               <p>After this manner it was that the Cardinal-Duke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oblige thoſe, that were weaker than himſelf, to ſubmit to his imperious Will, under a Pretence of doing Juſtice to the King's Reputation. All his Miniſtry was ſupported by the ſame Arrogance, becauſe he had to do with Perſons of very ordinary Diſcretion; and having full Power to oppoſe them with the Forces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all the King's Authority, he cruſhed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd them, before they were in a condition to ward his Blows.</p>

He likewiſe placed a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon in the Town, after he had turned out the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> Soldiers that the Prince had left there for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Place.</p>
               <p>This New Married Prince, whom we ſhall hereafter call <hi>Duke Nicholas Francis,</hi> ſent a Gentleman to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to acquaint the King with his Marriage, and to deſire him to order <hi>Luneville</hi> to be reſtored, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Princeſs to be ſet at liberty, ſince he was ready to obſerve all the Treaties that had been made with His Majeſty. As for what related to his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, they told his Envoy, That the King did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf about it; but they denied he was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſince he had liberty to walk all over the City of <hi>Nancy.</hi> But ſo far were they from delivering up any thing which they had taken, that under pretence that the Cardinal was of the ſame Humour with his Brother, they ſaid, The King was obliged, for his Security, to ſeize upon the remainder of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> In the mean time Duke <hi>Charles</hi> offer'd to deliver up <hi>la Mothe</hi> and <hi>Biche,</hi> two ſtrong Places, which he ſtill kept in his poſſeſſion, into the King's hands, if he would ſet his Brother and the Princeſſes at Liberty.</p>
               <p>But the Court of <hi>France</hi> thought it better to take them by main Force, and not to part with the Prince and Princeſſes, whoſe Rights they deſigned to make uſe of: So the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> was ordered to Block up <hi>la Mothe,</hi> till ſuch time as he could formally Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it.</p>

               <p>The Princeſs of <hi>Phaltsburg</hi> was kept more cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd at <hi>Nancy</hi> than any of the reſt, becauſe ſhe was of a Spirit much more difficult to manage, and had been the principal cauſe of her Siſter's Marriage. But as ſhe was the Perſon who found out means for that Princeſs to make her eſcape, ſhe contrived a way to eſcape her ſelf, notwithſtanding the Guards, by hiding her ſelf in the Seat of a Coach that was to carry one of her Gentlemen who was Sick, and Maimed in one of his Legs, out of the City, by vertue of a Paſsport he had procured. The Coach was examined at the City Gate, but they ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Gentleman lying upon a Quilt, which they did not ſearch. Within nine Miles of <hi>Nancy</hi> ſhe and her Cripple got on Horſeback, and took the way to <hi>Beſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> It was known ſhe had made her Eſcape two Hours after ſhe was gone, and a world of People were ſent to retake her, but they did not know what Road ſhe took. The Cardinal was exceedingly vexed at this new Trick which the Princeſs had play'd him, and was afraid that ſhe wou'd go directly to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> to conclude her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> which had been talked of ſome Years before.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> who was in <hi>Alſatia</hi> in the Imperial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, deſign'd in the mean time to ſurprize the French Camp before <hi>La Mothe,</hi> and having obtain'd ſome Troops of the Imperial Generals, he joyn'd them with his own, and marched on that ſide. But the Rhingrave <hi>Otho,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 12th <hi>of</hi> March.</note>, prevented him, and cut his Men in pieces, ſo that he was hardly able to make his Eſcape with a few Men into the <hi>Franche Comte,</hi> there to pick up the Remainders of his Army.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlicu,</hi> who was highly provoked becauſe Duke <hi>Nicholas Francis</hi> did not marry his Neice, though upon diſadvantageous Conditions, prepared to carry on his Tryal, ſince he was now no longer a Cardinal, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pretended Rape of <hi>Monſieur.</hi> The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> appointed a day for him and his Brother to anſwer to the Charge laid againſt them, as well as the Princeſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> and order'd the Prieſt that had married them to be apprehended. Theſe Formalities made it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, that in caſe theſe Princes did not appear, they wou'd be condemn'd for Obſtinacy, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Dominions.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:54967:51"/>
               <p>But neither did Duke <hi>Nicholas Francis,</hi> nor the Dutcheſs his Wife, think themſelves obliged to expect the end of this Tryal in <hi>Lorrain;</hi> ſo having found an opportunity to eſcape out of <hi>Nancy</hi> in a Diſguiſe, they retired to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Florence;</hi> only the Dutcheſs <hi>Nicole,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Charles,</hi> ſtill tarried in <hi>Nancy,</hi> in the Hands of the <hi>French.</hi> Some People were of Opinion that this new-married Couple were purpoſely ſuffer'd to eſcape, becauſe their Marriage having been approved of by the Pope, no Exceptions could be made againſt it. But the Court talked of re-uniting all <hi>Lorrain</hi> to the Crown, under a Pretence that it was formerly a Feif of the Counts of <hi>Champagne;</hi> and that this County having long ago fallen into the Hands of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> all that depended upon it ought to belong to them.</p>
               <p>While this paſſed in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Cardinal made great Promiſes to <hi>Monſieur</hi> and <hi>Puilaurens</hi> to draw them into <hi>France,</hi> for fear leaſt <hi>Gaſton</hi> ſhould reconcile himſelf to the Queen-Mother. It was generally expected that they wou'd now ſhortly return, ſince almoſt every thing they asked was granted them, except a place of Security. The Queen-Mother, who ſtill fell out more and more with the D. of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and found there was no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of adjuſting Differences with him, ſo long as <hi>Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurens</hi> continued near his Perſon, was at the ſame time inclined to make her Peace with the King, whatever it coſt her; and ſhe was ſo much the more diſpoſed to uſe this Conduct, becauſe ſhe perceived that the <hi>Marquiſs d' Aytone,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ſhew'd a greater Reſpect to <hi>Gaſton</hi> than her ſelf. She cauſed F. <hi>Chanteloube</hi> to write to <hi>Bouthillier,</hi> that ſhe was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to come and throw her ſelf upon his Majeſty's Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, and to be reconciled to the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> if the King commanded her to do it. <hi>Bouthillier</hi> carried this Letter to the King, ſeal'd as it was, and at the ſame time cauſed the Main that brought it, and came without a Paſſport, to be ſecured at his own Houſe. The King open'd it in the Cardinal's Preſence, where, beſides what is related above, he found that the Queen demanded a Paſſport to ſend one <hi>la Roche,</hi> who might come and go as Buſineſs required. F. <hi>Chanteloube</hi> ſaid that the Queen demanded nothing more for him, but that he might
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54967:51"/>peaceably end his Days in ſome Convent of his Order. Upon this the King aſſembled a Council, who as they were ſurpriſed to ſee the Queen-Mother paſs from one Extremity to another, ſo they imagin'd that there was ſome Artifice in this unaccountable Conduct. What help'd to confirm them in this Belief, was, that this <hi>la Roche</hi> had been the Accomplice of <hi>Alfeſton,</hi> and that another Man, who had been lately ſent to the Baſtile, accuſed F. <hi>Chanteloube</hi> afreſh. So they anſwered the Bearer of this Letter by word of mouth, That ſo ſoon as the Queen removed F. <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> and writ with her own hand, they wou'd give more Credit to it, than to ſuch blind Inſtructions as theſe were, which they had now received.</p>

               <p>But the King, inſtead of being influenc'd by thoſe Conſiderations that naturally preſented themſelves to his Mind, was eaſily perſwaded by the Cardinal to perſiſt in his Demands, that ſhe ſhou'd deliver up to him ſome of her Domeſticks, in order to receive farther Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which ſhe cou'd not do without renouncing the Principles of Humanity, and frighting all thoſe Perſons from her Service that ſhou'd have any Inclinations to ſerve her. So <hi>de Laleu</hi> being ordered to come to <hi>Ruel,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">The 19th of <hi>Febr.</hi>
                  </note> where the King was to meet him with the Cardinal, he accordingly went thither, but was ſurprized to find only the latter there. However, he was received with extraordinary Civility, and the Cardinal told him, that the profound Reſpect he had for the Perſon that ſent him, obliged him to ſhew him more if it were poſſible. But his Anſwer made it ſufficiently appear with what Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he delivered this Complement. He told him, <q>That the Queen-Mother had always been welcome, but that his Majeſty was willing to be ſatisfied that ſhe wou'd never be diſſwaded from that Deſire ſhe then expreſt wholly to ſubmit her ſelf to his Pleaſure, by thoſe malicious Spirits that had deceived her hitherto, and of which he could never be fully aſſured, ſo long as they were in the World: <hi>(for now it ſeems they were not content to have the Queen diſcard them, when they ſaw ſhe was inclined to do it:)</hi> That for this end the King demanded of her to deliver into his hands Father <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> the Abbot of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> and the Fellow that calculated Nativities, (<hi>he meant</hi> Fabbroni <hi>whom he afterwards named,</hi>) becauſe they had not only inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Queen, but likewiſe offended the King to that degree, that they muſt never hope to be pardoned: The firſt by his ill Counſels, the ſecond by his ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked Libels, and the third by his Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein he had given out that the King had but a ſhort time to live, which had made the Queen-Mother liſten to pernicious Counſels, diſorder'd the Royal Family, and done a mighty Diſſervice to the State: That therefore the Queen-Mother ought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther delay, to ſurrender up the Man that had put the King's Life in queſtion, as <hi>Fabbroni</hi> had done;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54967:53"/>the Man that by his defamatory Libels had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to take away his Reputation, as the Abbot of St. <hi>Germain</hi> had notoriouſly done; and laſtly, the Man that by attacking the Life of His Majeſty's moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, gave him all the juſt reaſon in the World to be apprehenſive of his own.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal added, That this would be an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way to convince all Mankind that ſhe diſapproved of their wicked Deſigns, and ſeem'd to teſtifie abundance of Joy that his Enemies had not been able to alienate the Queen-Mother's good Affections from him. He concluded with ſaying, <q>That he cou'd not forbear to inform the Queen with the ſame Freedom he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to her heretofore, that conſidering what had paſt, it was impoſſible but that the King muſt ſtill have ſome Diſtruſt: and that ſhe muſt reſolve to diſſipate it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, in order to build her Reconciliation upon a ſure and laſting Foundation: after which ſhe wou'd receive all imaginable Marks of natural Tenderneſs and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the beſt Son in the World, and ſhe wou'd ſee the Effects of the ſincere Inclinations of one of her Creatures, who in this Juncture cou'd not diſſent from the King's Intentions, without offending him ſenſibly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before <hi>de Laleu</hi> return'd to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> he received freſh Letters for the King and Cardinal, in which the Queen-Mother confirm'd the ſame things, in terms ſtill more humble and condeſcending, particularly in regard to the Cardinal. She likewiſe demanded a Paſſport for Father <hi>Suffren,</hi> her Confeſſor, whom ſhe deſired to ſend to Court. But Anſwer was made, that they wou'd hearken to no one, unleſs he brought them word from the Queen, that ſhe was ready to deliver into his Majeſty's hands the three Perſons he demanded of her. <hi>De Laleu</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> with this ſad Meſſage, which made the Queen loſe all hopes of ever ſeeing the King her Son again.</p>
               <p>While theſe Negotiations were managed by the Queen-Mother, <hi>Monſieur</hi> conſulted the Univerſity of <hi>Louvain</hi> about his Marriage, which they judged to be valid, and he got it to be ſolemnly confirmed by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Malines,</hi> in the preſence of ſeven Witneſſes. The Queen-Mother was deſired to be preſent at this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54967:53"/>Ceremony, but refuſed it, whether ſhe had reſolved to concern her ſelf no more with the Affairs of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> as ſhe had told him, or was not willing to diſoblige the King, at a time when ſhe endeavour'd to appeaſe him. However, when ſhe received the abovementioned News, ſhe was ſo far from complying with thoſe diſhonourable Submiſſions they expected from her, that ſhe beſtowed upon the Abbot of St. <hi>Germain</hi> the Place of her chief Almoner, which happen'd then to be vacant. At the ſame time the Court employ'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to engage the Pope to declare the Marriage of <hi>Monſieur</hi> null, by repreſenting to him all the Reaſons they could think of. But as theſe Reaſons only ſerved to cover their Deſire to hinder <hi>Monſieur</hi> from Marrying, the Pope, who was not prejudiced that way, formed great Difficulties upon all the Propoſals they made him.</p>
               <p>The ſureſt Expedient was to get the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> becauſe there they cou'd make him do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had a mind to; for which reaſon they laboured in private to effect it, although this Prince pretended to be as far from entring into any Reconciliation as ever he had been.

                  <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was extreamly out with the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> and the latter complained of him, becauſe in the Treaty which was ſecretly making with the Cardinal, he had demanded nothing in favour of him, ſave only that he ſhould not be excluded out of the Amneſty. While theſe Quarrels were on foot,<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 3d <hi>of</hi> May, Aub. Ibid. <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec.

Whoever it was that deſign'd to kill him, 'tis certain it did a great Injury to the Queen-Mother, who was now ſuſpected of deſigning to aſſaſſinate the Favourites of her two Sons,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54967:54"/>that ſo ſhe might manage them as ſhe ſaw convenient. However, others were of opinion, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was negotiating the Return of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> were reſolved to break off this Negotiation, by cauſing him that was the chief Promoter of it to be taken off. But as this Blow happened to miſcarry, it only retarded <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Return for a ſhort time, and made <hi>Puilaurens</hi> deſire it more than ever, who did not think himſelf any longer ſafe at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as it was highly neceſſary to conceal this Deſign from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for fear they might ſtop <hi>Monſieur</hi> and his Servants, beſides that the Treaty with the Cardinal was not yet concluded, this Prince enter'd into a new Treaty with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>

                     <hi>The</hi> 12th <hi>of</hi> May, Aub. <hi>Mem.</hi> T. 1. p. 425.</note> a few days after the Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that ſo they might not ſuſpect he deſigned to accommodate himſelf with the King his Brother. The principal Articles of this Treaty are as follow; by which it will appear that <hi>Gaſton</hi> who ſigned them, did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf much to keep his Word: That he engaged himſelf to enter into no ſort of Agreement with the King his Brother, whatever Advantages were offer'd him, and whatever Alterations might happen in <hi>France</hi> upon the Cardinal's ruine, for the ſpace of two years and a half, without the Conſent of his Catholick Majeſty: That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if he came to treat before that time was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, tho' it were by the Conſent of his Catholick Majeſty, he ſhould be obliged to break it when it pleaſed his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty: That in caſe any Rupture happen'd between the two Crowns, his Highneſs promis'd to take the part of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to ſupport its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts till a General Peace was concluded: That if the Arms of the Duke happen'd to make any progreſs in <hi>France,</hi> by the Taking of any Places, his Highneſs ſhou'd deliver up ſome of them to his Catholick Majeſty, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to re-imburſe him for the great Expences he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been at, and partly for an Aſſurance that he would be grateful to them one day, if his Highneſs came to the Crown; in which caſe, his Highneſs engaged fully to recompenſe them for all their Charges: That upon this Suppoſition, his Catholick Majeſty wou'd furniſh his Highneſs with 12000 Foot and 3000 Horſe, one half of which were to be <hi>French,</hi> and the other <hi>Spaniards:</hi> That
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54967:54"/>theſe Troops ſhou'd be ready to act towards the End of next <hi>September,</hi> and that then his Catholick Majeſty, if the ſtate of his Affairs wou'd permit him, ſhou'd draw his Troops towards the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> to alarm the King's Forces on that ſide, while his Highneſs enter'd the Kingdom at another: That his Catholick Majeſty wou'd give 70000 Crowns towards the raiſing of the French Troops, and 45000 each Month for their Subſiſtence, which however was to leſſen according as the Army ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; ſo that when they were once in <hi>France,</hi> his Catholick Majeſty ſhould not be obliged to be at any Charge for their Maintenance, ſince they might live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Contributions from the Country, as 'tis the way in <hi>Germany:</hi> That his Catholick Majeſty ſhou'd allow 15000 Crowns a Month for the Support of his Highneſs and Madam, as ſoon as <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſhou'd leave <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to march towards <hi>France,</hi> but that when he was arrived there, he and his Army were to live at the Expence of the Country where he reſided. This Treaty was ſigned by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Marquiſs <hi>d' Aytone,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> and <hi>Philaurens</hi> ſign'd it as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.

                  <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had lately put himſelf in the Service of <hi>Spain,</hi> were very urgent with the Queen-Mother to ſign this Treaty, and uſed her ill upon that Account: but ſhe had too much Reſolution and Prudence to engage her ſelf in a Treaty ſo directly oppoſite to the Intereſts of the King her Son: The Marquiſs <hi>d' Aytone</hi> having ſent this Treaty into <hi>Spain</hi> to have it ratified, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſigned it, and ſent back the Ratification of it by Sea.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec. T. 8. p. 84, &amp;c.</note> But the Veſſel which carried it happening to run a-ground upon the Coaſt of <hi>Calais,</hi> this Ratification was taken by the <hi>French,</hi> and ſent to Court, where perhaps it help'd to haſten the Cardinal to conclude the Treaty which he had begun with the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Abbot of <hi>Elbene</hi> made ſeveral Journeys for this purpoſe from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the principal Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty which retarded the Concluſion of it, reſpected the Perſon of Madam, whom the King wou'd have his Brother deliver up to him. It was likewiſe propoſed, That he ſhould conſent that thoſe Judges whom the Pope ſhould nominate out of the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54967:55"/>the Validity of his Marriage; but he wou'd give his Conſent neither to the one nor the other. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Monſieur had made with the Marquiſs <hi>d' Aytone</hi> was not perhaps kept ſo ſecret but they had ſome Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it in <hi>France</hi> before they happen'd to light upon the abovementioned Ratification, and the Abbot of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bene</hi> reproached Monſieur with it. It was alſo known that he had written to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he wou'd never agree that the <hi>French</hi> Eccleſiaſticks ſhould judge of this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and that he had complain'd that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> deſign'd to call in queſtion his Right of Succeſſion to the Crown, and for that end had made an Alliance with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Heretick Princes, at the time when <hi>Gaſton</hi> had married a Princeſs of a moſt Catholick Family.</p>
               <p>The Abbot of <hi>Elbene,</hi> at his Return to <hi>Paris,</hi> gave an Account of his Negotiation, and told them he was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of opinion, that if they let alone the buſineſs of the Princeſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> Monſieur would readily accept the Conditions that were offer'd him. But whether the King was poſſeſt with is ancient Jealouſie againſt his Brother, or whether the Cardinal was not willing that this Prince ſhould have a Lady that was obliged to the Queen-Mother for her Marriage, the Court obſtinately perſiſted to make him declare it null, under a Pretence that the King had not conſented to it.<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>41.</note> A Council was held juſt after the Abbot of <hi>Elbene</hi>'s Return, wherein the Cardinal was pleas'd to ſay, <q>That there were but two ways to preſerve the King from the ill Deſigns of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur; the firſt of which wholly depended upon the Bleſſing of Heaven, and the other upon his Majeſty's Prudence. The firſt was, if the King had a Son who might take away all hopes from the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> of ever finding the Throne vacant for himſelf. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, according to the Cardinal's Notion of Things, was, a firm Aſſociation between thoſe of whoſe Fidelity his Majeſty was aſſured; which might make Monſieur's Adherents ſenſible, that if they haſten'd that Prince's Succeſſion by any indirect means, they wou'd find per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons enough ready to chaſtiſe their Wickedneſs, and that even if the Throne happen'd to be vacant natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, he ſhou'd not take poſſeſſion of it without ſome Diſpute. The Reaſon of this was, that if Monſieur
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54967:55"/>believed that after the King's Deceaſe his Succeſſion might be vigorouſly conteſted, he would never deſire his Brother's Death. This Expedient, in the Cardinal's Opinion, was the only means to ſecure the King, and to preſerve the State from thoſe Dangers into which the Deſigns of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might throw it, as well as the Cabals of the diſaffected <hi>French;</hi> becauſe, whenever the King happen'd to die, neither one nor the other could then conſtrain Monſieur to act as they pleaſed; their Power being counterbalanc'd by that of the contrary Party; and that thus his Majeſty's Servants, being ſupported by the undoubted Right of Monſieur, might be in a condition to defend him againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and wou'd find their Security in endeavouring the Peace and Welfare of the Kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hiſtory no where informs us what Reflections were made upon this ſtrange Advice, but 'tis certain it fairly tended to give the Cardinal power to chuſe whom of the Princes of the Blood he ſhould pitch upon, to ſucceed to the Crown. This Miniſter who reproached Monſieur with having violated the fundamental Laws of the State, would have perſwaded his Majeſty, againſt all manner of Juſtice, and all received Precedents, to inveſt him with an Authority, to which the whole Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple has no right to pretend, in an hereditary Monarchy. Some time after,<note n="*" place="margin">Towards the beginning of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </note> Monſieur reconciled himſelf to the Queen his Mother upon the occaſion of a Difference that happen'd in his Family, in the heat of which the Queen ſent to offer him all her Servants, and to diſpoſe of them as he ſhould think fit. The Duke of <hi>Elbeuf</hi> likewiſe made up matters with Monſieur and <hi>Puilaurens;</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was ſo uncapable to regulate his Affairs at home, and to make himſelf beloved by his Domeſticks, that the greateſt part of them abandon'd him, without taking their leave of him, and withdrew into <hi>France,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Paſſports were refuſed them.</p>
               <p>Thus the Cardinal was in no great pain for any thing the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> might do, becauſe in gaining his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, he was aſſured to bring him to what Terms he pleas'd. The unſhaken and firm Reſolution of the Queen-Mother gave him a great deal more trouble; and as he carried Matters to the higheſt Extremities, he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54967:56"/>was afraid that this Princeſs, provoked to the greateſt degree, wou'd cauſe him at laſt to be aſſaſſinated if ſhe ſtill continued in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> which are but a few days Journey from <hi>Paris.</hi> Therefore he now thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh of ſending her to <hi>Florence,</hi> whither the Grand Duke offer'd to invite her, if the King thought it convenient. For this purpoſe<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec. Tom. 8. p. 93.</note> he obliged <hi>Gondi</hi> to take a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and make this Offer to the Queen, to ſee what Anſwer ſhe wou'd return to it. He was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that though ſhe abſolutely rejected it, yet it was good to let her know that the King wou'd not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at her going to <hi>Florence. Gondi</hi> undertook this Journey, and preſented to her a Letter from the Grand Duke, wherein he invited her to come and live with him, till ſuch time as ſhe was reconciled to the King. The Queen received this Complement very kindly, and told him, that the Grand Duke had a greater Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her than either her own Sons or her Sons-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, of which the former uſed her ill, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed her all manner of Aſſiſtance, or elſe were weary of giving it any longer. She ſeem'd to be very ſenſible of the Grand Duke's Kindneſs, and deſired time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of an Anſwer till <hi>Gondi</hi> who was going into <hi>Holland</hi> came back again. She gave him to underſtand, that ſhe was diſſatisfied with her Domeſticks, that Father <hi>Chanteloube</hi> wanted Integrity, and the Abbot of <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> was a Man of no Judgment; but ſhe cou'd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to turn them away, leaſt the World ſhould ſay that this was an open Acknowledgment that ſhe had been ill adviſed. The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as ſhe told him, did not furniſh her with what ſhe wanted, but ſlowly and with great Difficulty, and ſhe wanted ſeveral things that were neceſſary even for her own Perſon. <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> ſhe ſaid, was the Man that had begun to ruin her, and then had compleated her Deſtruction; becauſe after he had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her againſt the Cardinal, by ſwearing to her, that he wou'd never abandon her, he had, to regain this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late's Favour, acquainted him with what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, before Monſieur parted from <hi>Paris</hi> the firſt time. And afterwards this Man, fearing leaſt ſhe ſhou'd reſent this Injury, had done all that lay in his power to ruine her.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:54967:56"/>
               <p>At <hi>Gondi</hi>'s Return from <hi>Holland,</hi> the Queen told him ſhe was obliged to the Grand Duke for the great Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he expreſs'd towards her; but though ſhe did not abſolutely refuſe the Treat which he offer'd her, ſhe ſaid that <hi>Florence</hi> was too far from <hi>Paris,</hi> and that if ſhe went thither, her Affairs would go on with too much Slowneſs. Upon this Conſideration, ſhe reſerved that place to retire to, when ſhe was deſtitute of all Hopes to make an Accommodation. She once more intimated to <hi>Gondi,</hi> how little ſhe was ſatisfied with Father <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teloube,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>St. Germain,</hi> and <hi>Fabbroni,</hi> and own'd, that if the King gave her to underſtand that he was pleaſed ſhe ſhould diſmiſs them, ſhe would not fail to do it, but that ſhe would not after this run the risk of a Refuſal, as it had happen'd to her at the beginning of the Year, when they deſpiſed all her Submiſſions. She open'd her ſelf very frankly to <hi>Gondi,</hi> becauſe he was the Grand Duke's Reſident, whom ſhe believed to be well-affected to her Intereſts, and received his Advice very courteouſly. In all theſe Converſations, ſhe ſhed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tears, and ſhew'd all imaginable ſigns of a great Inclination to be reconciled to her Son, by throwing her ſelf wholly upon his Generoſity, and demanding nothing of him. Nay, ſhe ſaid that ſhe deſired to owe her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Cardinal, and that ſhe was very well ſatisfied that none but he could ſerve her. <hi>Gondi</hi> ſaw that ſhe was really in a Condition that deſerved Commiſeration, and her Diſcourſes were enough to have affected any one but thoſe ſhe had to deal with.</p>
               <p>At his Arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> he gave the Cardinal and the other Miniſters an Account of his Journey, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to repreſent to them the hearty Inclinations of the Queen-Mother in ſo feeling a manner, that it might touch them with pity. The Cardinal<note n="*" place="margin">The 17th of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </note> hearken'd to him with a great deal of Indifference, although he ſeem'd to be ſatisfied with his Negotiation. At laſt he told him, that ſo long as Father <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> who was convicted of a Deſign to kill him more than once, continued about the Queen, it was impoſſible to repoſe any Confidence in her, and that ſhe always ſaid the ſame things.</p>
               <p>

               <p>In the mean time Monſieur and He, full of Joy and Satisfaction for having obtained theſe Advantages of the Court, were contriving how to make their Eſcape with all ſpeed, for fear leaſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhou'd detain them if they came to ſuſpect their Deſign.

Monſieur took his Leave of no body, nay not of Madam her ſelf, whom he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recommended by a Letter to the Queen-Mother. From thence he marched directly to <hi>S.

Thoſe that were with him did the ſame, and the King received them all into Favour.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal came thither from <hi>Ruel,</hi> to viſit the Duke in his Majeſty's Preſence. He aſſured him that he had been extreamly concerned that his Abſence did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to do him thoſe Services which otherwiſe he had been ready to have done, and expreſſed a great deal of Joy that he was now able to ſerve him after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which had been ſo long deſired. The Duke told him that he was heartily ſorry that he had not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived ſooner, and that for the time to come he wou'd follow his Advice, and then embraced him.</p>
               <p>The next day the Duke went to <hi>Ruel</hi> to repay the Cardinal the Viſit he had made him, and entertain'd him in private, where 'tis ſuppoſed he told him all that he knew. The Cardinal afterwards treated him very ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, and with extraordinary Honour. After this, Monſieur went to his Eſtare at <hi>Limours,</hi> within five Leagues of <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Complements being now over, they began to diſcourſe of Affairs, and laboured to perſwade Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur to give his Conſent that his Marriage ſhou'd be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared void. The Duke rejected this Propoſal, as he had reaſon good, and alledged that his Conſcience wou'd not permit him to diſannul a Marriage, which after all cou'd not be juſtly condemned, although the King had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it. Upon this the Cardinal ſent ſeveral Divines to him, to cure him of theſe troubleſome Scruples, for he was ſeldom unprovided of dexterous Caſuiſts that knew how to accommodate his Paſſions to Religion. At firſt <hi>Puilaurens</hi> joyn'd with them; but becauſe Monſieur
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54967:58"/>cou'd not be brought to reliſh the Cardinal's Goſpel, it was ſuppoſed that this Favourite did not cordially repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Matter to the Prince, although he told them that for his part, he was very well ſatisfied with their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but ſince they had not wrought any Conviction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Monſieur, he would not pretend to force him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Cardinal ſtill kept to his Reſolution to beſtow his Couſin <hi>Mademoiſelle de Pont Chateau</hi> upon him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was not willing that the Marriage ſhould be yet conſummated, which made ſome People ſuſpect, that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was not ſo much in the Cardinal's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as he believed.</p>
               <p>The King, after he had paid to Monſieur the money which he had promis'd him, and expedited the Patents for <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> ſent F. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Bouthillier</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to tell him from him, that he wou'd never approve of his Marriage, though at the ſame time he wou'd never force him to marry again. Some more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines were afterwards ſent to him upon the ſame Errand, three of which were Jeſuits, three Secular Prieſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the General of the Fathers of the Oratory; but, in ſpite of all their Reaſons deduced from Politicks, which were founded upon the Jealouſie of the King and of his Miniſter, <hi>Gaſton,</hi> contrary to his cuſtom, ſtill maintain'd that his Marriage was valid. He told them, that ſince the Parliament were able to find out no other Reaſon for the Nullity of this Marriage, but the pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> it was unqueſtionably lawful, ſince of his own proper motion he had demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Siſter of them, and that they durſt not refuſe him: That as for himſelf, he cou'd be content to live ſeparated from his Wife to ſhew his Obedience to the King, but that he wou'd never conſent to marry another. Thus theſe ſeven Divines, after they had harangued him three full Hours to perſwade him to write to the King that he was convinced of the Nullity of his Marriage by their Reaſons, returned without doing any thing.</p>

                  <hi>Puilaurens</hi> began to be ſomewhat diſtruſtful that the Cardinal intended to deceive him, when this Miniſter ſent the Abbot of <hi>Elbene</hi> to Monſieur, who was then at <hi>Blois,</hi> to tell him, that the King was not diſpleas'd with his Conduct, and that the Cardinal deſired <hi>Puilaurens</hi> to

               <p>After having thus related the Diſorders of the Royal Family, and of Monſieur's Reconciliation, in which the Cardinal had no leſs a ſhare than the King; 'twill be now neceſſary to paſs to Foreign Affairs, which took up this Miniſter at the ſame time.</p>

                  <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Wife to Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> who had reſided at <hi>Nancy,</hi> came by Order of the Court to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe arrived the laſt day of <hi>April,</hi> and was received with great Reſpect, and conducted to the Palace of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> From thence ſhe went afterwards to <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> where the King entertained her very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly. However, as ſhe apprehended that when ſhe was at <hi>Paris</hi> they wou'd engage her in ſome Treaty, which might be contrary to the real Intereſts of her Houſe, ſhe had made a Declaration before ſhe left <hi>Nancy,</hi> in the preſence of a Notary, wherein ſhe ſignified, that being obliged by the King's Command to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe there proteſted, That whatever ſhe might do prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was to be reckon'd null, as being extorted by force.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54967:59"/>
               <p>There was no longer any Diſcourſe now in <hi>France</hi> to make uſe of this Princeſs's Name to keep <hi>Lorrain,</hi> nor of the Guardianſhip of the Places deliver'd up by Prince <hi>Charles.</hi> The King's Commiſſioners govern'd that Dutchy as if it had been a Conquer'd Province, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Revenues of it without any Diſturbance from the Duke's Officers. They augmented the Impoſts and Taxes, which exceedingly oppreſſed the poor People, who ſtill continued well affected to their ancient Princes. About this time an Edict of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was ſtuck up in ſeveral places, wherein he prohibited his Subjects to obey the <hi>French,</hi> whom he called Uſurpers and Tyrants. This Edict gave ſuch Offence at Court, becauſe they imagined the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> knew the Contents of it to be true, that they immediately order'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to re-aſſume the Proceſs which had for ſome time been diſcontinued againſt the Duke, as a Vaſſal of the Crown, as well for the pretended Rape of Monſieur, as for ſeveral other notorious Miſdemeanours. For this end the Parliament ſent to Duke <hi>Charles</hi> to make his perſonal Appearance on a day appointed at the Palace of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> without having any regard to the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs that lived there, and complain'd of it to the Cardinal to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>While the Dutcheſs was at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> took the Caſtle of <hi>Biche,</hi> and afterwards <hi>La Mothe,</hi> which ſurrender'd by Compoſition on the 28th of <hi>July,</hi> after which there remained no other places in <hi>Lorrain</hi> that durſt hold out for the ancient Lords of this Country.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec. Tom. 8. p. 108.</note> So the Parliament having confiſcated the Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> the Cardinal cauſed the Decree to be executed with all imaginable Vigour. He erected a Court of Juſtice at <hi>Nancy,</hi> which adjudged to the King abundance of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> as having been alienated from the three Biſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun.</hi> He likewiſe got the Remainder of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to be ſolemnly ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, towards the Expences of the War, and obliged the Clergy, the Nobility, and the People, to take an Oath of Fidelity to the King. This Country was now look'd upon to be part of the Kingdom, which had formerly been taken from it by Uſurpation and Violence; ſo that now they ſaid it was but juſt to re-unite it to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54967:60"/>Crown; and to hinder the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> from making any Inſurrections for the future, they cauſed ſeveral places to be diſmantled, where they might have lodged themſelves, unleſs the King would have kept Garriſons there, which wou'd have required a prodigious Expence.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal had all along kept a mighty correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> till ſuch time as he thought he might be able to effect by <hi>Walleſtein</hi>'s means a great part of what he did by the help of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army.

He maintain'd a private Commerce with the Marquiſs <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> the King's Ambaſſador in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the King promis'd to aſſiſt him. As <hi>Walleſtein</hi> paſſed for one of the chief Captains of his time, and was extreamly beloved by the Soldiery, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he wou'd at leaſt give the Emperour a great deal of Trouble.

                     <hi>Auſtria</hi> would be no leſs provoked againſt her, and only believe that this proceeded from her Weakneſs and Fear: That his Majeſty cou'd not poſſibly act worſe than ſo to manage Matters as to let <hi>France</hi> alone ſuſtain the ſhock of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which wou'd moſt infallibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen if they did not take care to maintain the Party which had given that Houſe ſo much trouble for ſo many years: That in reſolving to ſupport them, the worſt that cou'd fall out was to keep up the War in <hi>Germany</hi> by the Aſſiſtance of the Confederate Proteſtant Princes; whereas otherwiſe they muſt ſoon expect to behold the ſame War in the heart of <hi>France,</hi> without having any Friends to help them: That therefore the beſt way wou'd be to encourage theſe Princes, to find out Money, and raiſe ſufficient Forces to ſtrengthen the Army of the Mareſchals <hi>de la Force</hi> and <hi>de Brezé,</hi> who were appointed to command in <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <p>This Advice was follow'd, and Orders were ſent in the mean time to the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force,</hi> who was in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to advance towards the <hi>Rhine</hi> to oppoſe the progreſs of the Imperialiſts, that already threaten'd to joyn the Army of the Marquiſs <hi>d'Aytone</hi> and of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and with them to enter <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Several places of <hi>Alſatia</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes</hi> were forced to abandon to form an Army out of the Forces of theſe Garriſons, put themſelves under the protection of <hi>France,</hi> that they might not fall into the hands of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54967:63"/>had the greateſt credit with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> next to <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> was of the ſame humour, and had as little Inclination to comply with the Miniſter's pleaſure as the other. The Cardinal fanſied he was the Man that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed <hi>Philaurens</hi> with theſe ambitious Thoughts; ſo that he reſolved to remove him. Upon this he tells <hi>Puilau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> that ſince he had contracted ſo near an Alliance with him, he was deſirous to be united ſtill more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, but that he cou'd not do it, ſo long as he kept Company with <hi>Coudrai Montpenſier,</hi> and reckoned him one of his beſt Friends. Whether <hi>Philaurens</hi> diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Cardinal had ſome Deſign upon him, or elſe was reſolved to pay no farther regard to this Miniſter, inſtead of diſcarding him, as he was deſired, he gave him the next Apartment to his own; which procedure began to incenſe the Cardinal, whom all the other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters obeyed at the firſt word, and who cou'd not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt this Oppoſition from the Favourite of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> whom he had ſo far honour'd, as to give him one of his Relations in Marriage.</p>
               <p>Monſieur generally reſided at <hi>Blois,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mem. Rec. <hi>T. 8.</hi> P. <hi>199,</hi> &amp;c.</note> it happen'd while he was there, that ſeveral <hi>Spaniards</hi> of Quality who travell'd from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Spain</hi> by Land, came to <hi>Blois</hi> to pay their Reſpects to him, who received them very courteouſly. He frequently mention'd the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that Country with great eſteem, as if he intended to ſhew his Gratitude for the kind Reception he found among them, and engage them to uſe Madam well, who ſtill continued in their Territories. This made Don <hi>Criſtoval Benavides,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, ſay, That although Monſieur left the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> without taking his leave; yet if he went thither a hundred times, and came back as often after the ſame manner, he ſhould ſtill find a hearty Welcome there. This Conduct of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, and the Diſcourſes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> gave the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters occaſion to ſuſpect, that he ſtill kept ſome private Intelligence with them, or at leaſt preſerv'd an Affection to that Nation, which might be prejudicial to <hi>France</hi> in the preſent poſture of Affairs. On the other hand, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> continually proteſted, that if the King cou'd find any way to diſſolve his Marriage legally, he wou'd not oppoſe it; but that he wou'd never go to tell
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54967:63"/>the Parliament a Sham-ſtory that he was forced to this Match by the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſince he cou'd neither do it in Conſcience nor in Honour. He praiſed the Princeſs <hi>Margaret</hi> exceedingly, and preferr'd her infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, for her good Qualities, to his firſt Wife. He frequently writ to her, and ſent her Money, Cloaths, Liveries for her Servants, two Coaches, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns a Month towards her Expence.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal was of opinion, that this inflexible ſteadineſs of Monſieur cou'd only proceed from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Puilaurens:</hi> nay, he pretended that this ſhew'd him to be ill affected to the King's Perſon, and that he deſired to behold the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> upon the Throne, that he might become chief Miniſter of State; as if the Marriage of Monſieur had any relation to the King's Death. <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was accuſed of being familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one <hi>Vieux-Pont,</hi> a Domeſtick of Monſieur, who had ſpoken ſcandalouſly of His Majeſty. He was likewiſe charged with keeping a correſpondence with the Houſe of <hi>Lorrian;</hi> and that the reaſon why he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this Marriage was, that this Houſe might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Prince, in caſe the King happen'd to die. Thus it was interpreted a Crime in the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wou'd not depend upon the Diſcretion of the Miniſter for his Succeſſion to the Crown; and yet this Miniſter muſt be allow'd to take what Securities he pleas'd againſt the whole Royal Family, and all the Princes of the Blood.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal, who had always taken great care to keep up that Jealouſie which the King ever ſince his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy had entertain'd againſt his Brother, eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him that all theſe Practices of Monſieur only tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dethrone him, and that there was no other way to prevent the Deſigns of his Domeſticks, but to deſtroy them. So the King was reſolved to apprehend <hi>Puilau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens;</hi> and that he might ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>iving of means to draw him from <hi>Blois</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> To effect this, a Ball was propoſed at the <hi>Carnaval,</hi> where Monſieur and <hi>Puilaurens</hi> were invited to dance, as well as the King. They came to <hi>Paris</hi> upon this Occaſion, and Monſieur was mightily careſs'd on all hands, though they cou'd not prevail with him to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54967:64"/>make the leaſt ſtep towards the Diſſolution of his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The 14th of <hi>February</hi> was the Day agreed upon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Puilaurens;</hi> and the Guards at the <hi>Louvre</hi> were order'd to be doubled. This had like to have diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Plot; for a Footman belonging to the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> having obſerved it, went to his Maſter to bid him have a care of himſelf, becauſe the Court had ſome extraordinary Deſign on foot. This Prince came to the <hi>Louvre</hi> about Two a clock in the Afternoon, to practiſe the Ball before-hand, when he received this Advice; but as foreſight was none of his Talents, he neglected it, and went to the King's Chamber, where he ſtayed till the Cardinal came there. They had ſent to find him out at the Keeper of the Seals, where he dined, and carried the Marquiſs <hi>Du Fargis</hi> and <hi>Coudrai Montpenſier</hi> with him. When he went away he took <hi>du Fargis</hi> to the <hi>Louvre</hi> along with him, and gave Orders for the other to be apprehended when he offer'd to be gone; which was accordingly executed. Every thing was ready at the <hi>Louvre</hi> to begin the Ball, and none of the Company were wanting but only <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> who made the reſt wait above half an hour after the time appointed; which made the King and the Cardinal ſuſpect that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Deſign againſt him. At laſt he came, and after he had diſcourſed ſome time with the King, the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Cardinal, and other Noblemen of the Court that were preſent, the King took Monſieur by the hand, and led him to his Cloſet. This was the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal they agreed upon with the Marquiſs <hi>de Gordes,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Charot,</hi> Captains of the Life-Guards, when they were to arreſt <hi>Puilaurens</hi> and <hi>du Fargis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They immediately executed the King's Orders, and theſe two Domeſticks of the Monſieur were taken up without any noiſe. The King, as ſoon as he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved notice of it, told this Prince what he had done, and at the ſame time embraced him, and aſſured him that he was perfectly well ſatisfied with him. He added that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was an ungrateful Wretch, and that Monſieur cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d never expect to be well ſerv'd by him, after his horrid Ingratitude to the Crown which had been ſo kind to him. The Duke ſeem'd to be ſomewhat concerned
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54967:64"/>at it; but fearing to be ſerved after the ſame manner himſelf, he ſaid he would abandon <hi>Puilaurens</hi> for ever, if he had made any unhandſome Returns to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Favours. The Cardinal came afterwards into the King's Cloſet, whoſe Preſence hearten'd Monſieur a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for he concluded that if there had been any Deſign to apprehend him, the Cardinal durſt not appear in that place. This Miniſter complimented him afreſh, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him it was his Majeſty's Pleaſure, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ſhou'd aſſiſt at the Council. Monſieur asked him whether the King gave him leave to ſtir out of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and go the Palace of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> where he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Cardinal told him he might go when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; ſo this Prince, after he had waited upon the Queen at her Apartment, where the King then was, retired. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he returned to the <hi>Louvre</hi> towards the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although ſeveral of his Domeſticks had been ſeized. <hi>Puilaurens</hi> and <hi>du Fargis</hi> lay at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and were conducted the next day to the Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes;</hi> but <hi>Coudrai Montpenſier</hi> was carried to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this the King publiſh'd a circular Letter, which was ſent to the Parliaments, and to the Governours of Provinces, to acquaint them, that he had been obliged, for ſeveral weighty Reaſons, to apprehend ſome of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur's Domeſticks. It was penn'd in an obſcure ſtyle, becauſe the Priſoners were not as yet convicted of any crime; but moſt People concluded, that the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter had cauſed <hi>Puilaurens</hi> to be confin'd, becauſe he cou'd not truſt him any longer, and that he wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps carry his Revenge farther. <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſent the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de la Valette</hi> and <hi>Bouthillier</hi> to Monſieur, to give him freſh Aſſurances, that he was wholly at his Service, and to tell him, he was heartily ſorry that <hi>Puilaurens</hi> had forced the King, by committing freſh crimes, to take ſo rigorous a courſe with him. It was obſerved that the Cardinal did not go himſelf to the Palace of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> fearing perhaps leaſt a fancy ſhould take the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to revenge this ill Uſage. This Prince told them, that he had promis'd to be a faithful Servant to the King, and a Friend of the Cardinal, and that he wou'd keep his Word: That if he found <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was really guilty, let his fault be what it wou'd, he wou'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54967:65"/>be ſo far from making any Interceſſion for him, that he wou'd be the firſt man that ſhou'd demand Juſtice upon him: That he did not believe he had committed any new crimes: and, That if he kept any commerce with <hi>Vieux-Pont,</hi> it was about ſome matters of Gallantry in <hi>Flauders,</hi> and not Affairs of State: That if they thought it proceeded from the Advice of <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> that he ſtuck to his Marriage, they were mightily deceived: and, That neither <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> nor any other man in the World, ſhou'd make him give his conſent to a Thing which he believ'd to be againſt his conſcience. This unalterable Reſolution of <hi>Gaſton</hi> ſtrangely perplex'd the Cardinal, who cou'd not endure to ſee him married to a Princeſs whoſe family he had ſo lately ruin'd. It was likewiſe no ſmall Mortification to the Miniſter, that People laugh'd at the <hi>Arreſt</hi> which he had ſent to the Parliament, by which they were to declare, that Monſieur cou'd not contract a Marriage in <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> return'd to <hi>Blou;</hi> from which place, merely for his Diverſion, he took a Journey as far as <hi>Nantes,</hi> which made the Court believe that he went thither to ſhip himſelf for <hi>England;</hi> but his Return diſſipated the Fears they began to entertain that he wou'd go out of the Kingdom again. In the mean time <hi>Puilaurens</hi> died at <hi>Vincennes</hi>

The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was extreamly concern'd at the News; and this was the ſecond of his Favourites whom the Cardinal had caus'd to die in Priſon, without convicting them of any other crime than that unpardonable one of not being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoted to his Pleaſure. Few people regretted the death of <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> whoſe Pride and Arrogance had render'd him inſupportable to all Mankind. Ever ſince his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement the Court had given Monſieur a Council, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſuch perſons as had an entire Dependence upon the Cardinal. <hi>Bouthillier</hi> was the chief of it, with the Title of Chancellour; and the others were the Abbot of <hi>Elbene, Goulas</hi> his Secretary, and the Abbot of <hi>La Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere</hi> his Chaplain.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Cardinal ſummon'd the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> to meet at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the King ſent to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly

The Queen-Mother having received Advice of this Declaration, writ to <hi>Rome</hi> to deſire his Holineſs to forbid the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> to interpoſe in this Affair; becauſe it was notorious to all the World, that this Convocation was almoſt wholly compoſed of Court-Biſhops, who to advance their own Fortunes, were ready to ſay every thing the King and his Miniſter wou'd have them; and that if it was the King's Pleaſure, nay if one of his Miniſters was of a different Opinion, they wou'd find no Difficulty to frame another Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directly oppoſite to the former.</p>
               <p>Leſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might obtain of the Pope a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration contrary to that of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> or leſt his Holineſs might expreſs his Diſlike of it,<note n="†" place="margin">The 12th of <hi>October.</hi>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54967:66"/>King. The Expedient he made uſe of, to hinder this Letter from producing any effect, was, to accuſe the Queen-Mother for having endeavour'd to corrupt the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the means of one <hi>Clauſel,</hi> who was hanged for that reaſon. The Contents of this Letter principally related to the War, from which the Queen endeavour'd to diſſwade her Son by all manner of Arguments. She told him, among other Things, <hi>That War is never juſt but when it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and that the Juſtice and Neceſſity of it are only found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Preſervation and Defence, which are not lawful but when all other means are inſufficient; that War is an Evil which is not tolerated but to avoid a greater: And what Evil,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>are you conſtrain'd to avoid? and what Advantage can you expect equal to the Loſs you expoſe your ſelf to? Hitherto you have been the Arbitrator of Peace and War, but ſo ſoon as you quit the Quality of a Judge for that of a Party, neither of the two will any longer depend upon you. The Forces, the Conduct, and the Intereſts of your Enemies will be balanced with yours. The diſproportion between them not being extraordinary, conſequently the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs cannot be infallible; and if they are uncertain, how can you be aſſured that the ill, which muſt of neceſſity hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to one of the two Parties, will not fall upon yours.</hi> She afterwards repreſented to him the Miſchiefs which <hi>France</hi> might ſuffer by this War, and told him, that his Father had always recommended to her to keep the Kingdom in Peace with her Neighbours; and that if ever ſhe ſaw the King her Son ready to declare War againſt them, <hi>She was to conjure him by his aſhes, and by his memory, not to come to thoſe Extremities; or if he happen'd to be engaged in them, ſhe ſhou'd perſwade him to bring a ſpeedy remedy to them, and liſten to a Peace, as being the propereſt means to preſerve what he had left him, having purchaſed it with his own blood, and by the perils and fatigues of twenty years.</hi>

                  <hi>Mazarine,</hi> to acquit himſelf outwardly of his Duty as Nuncio Extraordinary, who was ſent on purpoſe for the Peace, deſired the King to anſwer this Letter; but the King refus'd to do it. He alledg'd, for the reaſon of his ſilence, that if he anſwer'd a Letter ſo ſeditious, ſo much inclining to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, and ſo full of pretended
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54967:67"/>Affection, while the Queen-Mother endeavour'd to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> he ſhou'd be forced to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the great Injury ſhe did to <hi>France:</hi> That ſhe made a great Buſtle about the Advice of the late King, to maintain a Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> but that the deſign of it was, to decry the preſent Government, to render the Cardinal odious, and to cauſe an Inſurrection of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: That when the Queen-Mother wou'd carry her ſelf truly like a Mother, he wou'd honour her as ſuch; and that it was purely out of reſpect to her, that he wou'd not anſwer her Letter; but that the Nuncio might return her ſuch an Anſwer as he ſhou'd think convenient.</p>
               <p>All this while<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri,</hi> Ibid. p. 360.</note> Monſieur continued firm in his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not to agree to have his Marriage declared null. All that they cou'd draw from him was, That if the Pope declared he might marry again in Conſcience, he wou'd do whatever the King deſired of him: probably becauſe he knew the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> wou'd never conſent to it. He only expreſſed himſelf in this manner when he was at Court; for when he was at home, he did not ſpeak a word, not daring to open his mind to any of thoſe that were about him, whom he knew to be the Cardinal's Creatures. He often appeared extreamly thoughtful and melancholy, ſo that nothing cou'd divert him.</p>
               <p>People remark'd another thing at Court, which was, That the Cardinal had ſo ordered Affairs that the Privy-Council met at his Palace at <hi>Ruel,</hi> whither the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was uſed to come from <hi>S. Germain</hi> or <hi>Verſailles.</hi> It is true indeed, he excuſed it upon the ſcore of his Illneſs, but as his Indiſpoſition was not ſo great but he cou'd walk out in his Garden, ſeveral perſons were of opinion that he was afraid of being in a place where he was not the ſtrongeſt. If he went at any time to <hi>S. Germain,</hi> it was at ſuch times as no body cou'd tell whether he wou'd go thither or no, as if he did it purpoſely to break any meaſures that might be taken againſt him. But after all, if the King was reſolved to deſtroy him, all theſe precautions were uſeleſs; for he had found in a moment, all the Court and Kingdom upon his hands. The Princes of the Blood whom he treated ſo diſreſpectfully, and the People whom he daily oppreſſed with new Impoſts and Taxes, equally hated him, and nothing was capable to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54967:67"/>ſave him. Thus this mighty Authority, founded whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the King's Weakneſs, and a perpertual ſeries of Acts of Violence, was attended with no little Inquietude.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Cardinal, being reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his poſt by the ſame ways as he had hitherto uſed, continued to act with the ſame heat againſt the Queen-Mother. As ſoon as he knew that Abbot <hi>Fabbroni</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> in Quality of Reſident from the Queen-Mother, he complain'd of it to the Pope by the Count <hi>de Noailles,</hi> who told him, That the Queen-Mother not being a Soveraign, but a Subject of the King, had no right to keep a Reſident at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that ſhe ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France.</hi> The Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that ſimple Biſhops had their Agents there, and that there were ſeveral Examples of the like nature. But whether he ſent to inform <hi>Fabbroni</hi> of it, or whether the latter was afraid of having ſome Affront put upon him, he retired immediately to <hi>Florence,</hi> and thus eas'd the Cardinal of the trouble to get him removed from that place.</p>
               <p>The Queen-Mother provoked to the higheſt degree to find her Deſign of keeping a Reſident at <hi>Rome</hi> thus oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, writ a long<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dated</hi> Dec. 7. <hi>See Aubery,</hi> l. 4. c. 54.</note> Letter to the Pope, wherein ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Cardinal's Conduct in very ſevere terms. She told him that this Miniſter, who ſet the Ambaſſadour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch an impertinent Harangue, very fooliſhly urged that ſhe was to make uſe of the King's Ambaſſadour, a thing againſt common ſenſe, it being certain that theſe Ambaſſadours wou'd concern themſelves in nothing ſhe deſired them to do, without an expreſs Order from the King: That it was impoſſible for her to get any thing deliver'd to His Majeſty, ſince Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of all means of acquainting him with her Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, by Letters, or otherwiſe: That the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours who abſolutely depended upon the good Will of the Cardinal, were obliged to act according to the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Miniſter, to avoid the loſs of their Lives, their Eſtates, and Honours. That thus they treated, with no other D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54967:68"/>without ever deſigning to effect it: That they made no Scruple to overturn all Laws, both Divine and Humane, to fly directly in the face of the Apoſtolick Authority, and to violate the Sacraments of the Church, by their endeavouring to break off the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> That ſhe deſir'd the Pope to allow her the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep a Reſident, to give him an Account of all that ſhe knew, which might facilitate a General Peace: That the Cardinal abundantly diſcovered his Hatred and Malice againſt her by ſeeking to rob her of an Honour which belonged to her: That the King had no hand in theſe Violences, and that he durſt not open his mind to thoſe that were about him, who were all gained over to the Cardinal by Bribes, or elſe aw'd out of their Duty by the fear of puniſhment: That he attempted by his Threats to gain an Abſolute power over his Holineſs; but that ſhe cou'd aſſure the Pope, that although the Cardinal was capable of all ſorts of Wickedneſs, yet he was of ſo fearful a Temper, that he durſt never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo horrible and ſo impious an Attempt as that was with which he had threaten'd him, <hi>She means his deſign perhaps to make himſelf Patriarch of France:)</hi> That the Emperour and Catholick King had not condemn'd the Affection ſhe expreſs'd towards <hi>France,</hi> nor diſapproved of her Deſires of a Peace, but on the contrary, had eſteem'd her the more for it: That the Cardinal wou'd rather conſent to have all <hi>France</hi> embroil'd, than ſuffer her to concern her ſelf about a Peace. In the whole courſe of this Letter, ſhe repreſents the King as more depending upon his Miniſter than the Miniſter upon him, although ſhe ſeems deſirous to excuſe the King all along.</p>
               <p>However, this Letter produced no effect, ſince, as it has been already ſaid, <hi>Fabbroni</hi> was forced to withdraw to <hi>Florence;</hi> and the Efforts the Queen-Mother uſed to incline <hi>France</hi> to a Peace, had no better Succeſs.</p>

The Count afterwards made the Cardinal a Viſit, which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54967:68"/>was a thing he had never done before, becauſe he cou'd not ſuffer this Prelate to take the Right-hand of him at his Houſe, according to the cuſtom of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>After ſeveral Propoſals, to no purpoſe, concerning the means of accommodating the Differences of the Crowns by the way of Negotiation, they began on both ſides to make preparations for an open War.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 24th <hi>of</hi> January.</note> About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Year <hi>Philipsburg</hi> was ſurprized by the Imperialiſts, under the conduct of <hi>Braumberger,</hi> who had been Governour of the place before it fell into the hands of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Some Soldiers, apparell'd like Peaſants, and driving ſome Waggons laden with Wine, cut the Throats of the <hi>Corps de Garde,</hi> while <hi>Braumberger</hi> ſcaled the place on another ſide; and this was done ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon were made Priſoners, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Governour, before they were in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to defend themſelves, or make their Eſcape. The Cardinal received this unwelcome News with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary concern, by reaſon of the Importance of the place, and the great Booty which the Enemies found there. The Magazines were full of all ſorts of Ammunition and Proviſion, and there was above two hundred thouſand Crowns in ready money, to ſupply the Neceſſities of the Army, which was in Winter-Quarters in <hi>Bergſtraat.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, this place had coſt four hundred thouſand Crowns, which they gave the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to oblige them to deliver it up to <hi>France;</hi> and the Cardinal's Flatterers had publiſhed, that his Eminence had found a way to make the ſtrongeſt place in <hi>Germany</hi> fall into the King's hands without ſo much as drawing a Sword for it, which ſerved to bridle the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and ſeveral other Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which was a ſecure Paſs upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and where an Arſenal and Magazine might be made, by the means of which, they might, whenever they pleaſed, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the War into the very heart of <hi>Germany.</hi> The greater Value the Cardinal had ſet upon this Acquiſition, the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54967:69"/>more did the Loſs of it mortifie him. The King likewiſe was ſo concerned at this Diſgrace, that whereas he was wholly employ'd about the Cloaths for the Ball above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, he retired the next day to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> which wonderfully diſpleaſed the Cardinal, who wou'd have fain diſſembl'd this Loſs. Nevertheleſs, not finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fit to attend State-Affairs in the preſent Agitation of his Mind, he went to <hi>Ruel,</hi> under a pretence that his Health required it; and 'tis reported, that the King went to <hi>Verſailles</hi> before, to give him an opportunity to leave <hi>Paris.</hi> Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> who was related to <hi>Arnaud</hi> the Governour, and who had procured him that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was under no leſs a Confuſion, while the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Cardinal and his Confident rejoyced to ſee their Vanity puniſhed.</p>
               <p>To prevent the dangerous Conſequences which the Loſs of <hi>Philipsburg</hi> might occaſion, Orders were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to the Mareſchals <hi>de la Force</hi> and <hi>de Brezé,</hi> not to ſtir from <hi>Bergſtraat,</hi> till <hi>Manheim</hi> and <hi>Heidelburg</hi> were fortified as well as their Situation would permit. After this, it was judged expedient that the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> ſhould joyn his Army with that of his Majeſty, to beat the Imperialiſts out of the Country of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> and to deliver <hi>

               <p>The Reſult of the Diet of <hi>Wormes</hi> was, That the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be forthwith acquainted that they wou'd act with all imaginable Vigour for the Common Cauſe; and that they deſired him at the ſame time to pay the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Circles</hi> commanded by the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> conſiſting of ſeven thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe.

                  <hi>French</hi> had ſuffer'd in the <hi>Bergſtraat,</hi> and in the Expedition of <hi>Spire</hi> which was ſomewhat of the earlieſt, occaſion'd great ſickneſs in the Army.

The Army of the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> was not in much better circumſtances; ſo that it was not ſafe to rely either upon one or the other. In the mean time the Cardinal thought fit to draw off ſome of the <hi>German</hi> Regiments to join them with the Army of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> which was to act in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and on the ſide of <hi>Cermany</hi> he reſolved to be upon the Defenſive, only to hinder the Imperialiſts from entring <hi>Lorrain.</hi> Orders were ſent to <hi>Feuquieres</hi> to raiſe 12000 <hi>Germans</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the Army of the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them under him.

The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Jean de Werth</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached likewiſe on the ſame ſide, ſo that now it was to be feared that they wou'd enter into <hi>France</hi> with an Army of 25000 Horſe, and as many Foot, ſince there were not Forces ſufficient to oppoſe their March: The Armies of <hi>Germany</hi> were not in a condition to make Head againſt them, and the reſt were employ'd either in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> or in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Levies that had been rais'd to enlarge and compleat the Troops commanded by the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force,</hi> and <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> were in a manner come to nothing, partly by Deſertions, and partly by the Treachery of the Colonels and Captains, who received Pay for compleat Companies, although they had not half the effective Soldiers they were obliged to have.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that knew the preſent ſtate of Affairs, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to behold a flouriſhing Kingdom, full of Men and Money, which paid above a hundred and fifty thouſand Men, out of a Deſign to humble the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſhou'd have no more than ſix thouſand Horſe and twenty thouſand Foot to oppoſe an Army of fifty thouſand Men; ſo that it might juſtly fear to ſee the Imperial Colours in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54967:71"/>a ſhort time all about <hi>Paris.</hi> This ſufficiently diſcovered how ſlightly the Cardinal had engag'd himſelf in a War, which was not to be managed like a Court-Intrigue, by Tricks, and putting Chimera's into the King's Head.</p>
               <p>But the Imperialiſts, inſtead of ſpeedily executing the Deſign which had been propoſed to enter into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Champagne,</hi> loſt a great deal of time unprofitably. <hi>Galas</hi> retired to <hi>Sarbruck</hi> till the reſt came up to him, where he in a manner block'd up <hi>Mentz, Creutſnack,</hi> and other Places belonging to the <hi>Swedes;</hi> but this was nothing in compariſon of what the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Army might have done, if they had gone immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Champagne.</hi> In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> marched to cover <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and hinder'd <hi>Galas</hi> from making any Attempts on that ſide: nay, he offer'd to force this General to re-paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> if they would ſpeedily ſend him 3000 Horſe and 15000 Foot.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal, who was afraid that the Imperialiſts wou'd take thoſe Advantages which their Numbers as well as the Opportunity it ſelf had put into their hands, told his truſty Confident Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> 
                  <q>That he ſaw the Kingdom was in a very dangerous condition, and that he knew not what Remedies to apply to it; that the Levies that had been raiſed, dwindled to nothing in a ſhort time; and, that there was no Fidelity or Truth in the Officers: That there were not Forces enough to oppoſe the Imperial Armies if they joyn'd to make their way into <hi>France;</hi> and that the 12000 <hi>Switzers,</hi> and the ſame number of <hi>French</hi> which he gave Orders to be raiſed, could not be got ready before the Month of <hi>September:</hi> That if the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> had not ſtop'd the Progreſs of <hi>Galas, Lorrain</hi> had been already loſt, with the three Biſhopricks of <hi>Metz, Thoul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun.</hi>
                  </q> This Capuchin, whom a little matter could not aſtoniſh, told the Cardinal, that he muſt take Courage, and particularly apply himſelf to beat <hi>Galas</hi> back: That he muſt place another General over the Army in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> re-inforce it as well as he cou'd, and hinder the Cheats of the Officers: That laſtly, he muſt keep up and cultivate the Alliance with the <hi>Switzers,</hi> that ſo he might be furniſhed with Men from thence, and that this wou'd be ſo much the eaſier done, becauſe their Penſions were not paid them by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

               <p>In purſuance of this Advice the Cardinal<note n="*" place="margin">The 26th of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> paid <hi>Poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi>'s Agent at <hi>Paris,</hi> three hundred thouſand Livres for the payment of his Army, and ſixty five thouſand for himſelf, the better to encourage him to fight <hi>Galas;</hi> however, he wou'd not make any Treaty for the future. The Mareſchal <hi>de la Force,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> had Orders to have an eye upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and upon Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> to hinder him from invading it, as 'twas believed he had a Deſign. Orders were likewiſe diſpatched to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who deſired to command an Army, and whoſe Inclinations were by no means ſuitable to his Dignity, to go and place himſelf at the Head of a ſmall Body of Men, whom he was to joyn with the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Weimar. Galas</hi> had beſieged <hi>Kaiſerſlauter,</hi> and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up <hi>Mentz,</hi> and the Duke was not ſtrong enough to raiſe the Siege, or break the Blockade. He was ſo much the more concerned to preſerve that place, becauſe he had laid up there the moſt conſiderable part of the Booty which he had got ſince the Entrance of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> into <hi>Germany.</hi> For this reaſon he had put ſome of his beſt Troops into the Town; and among the reſt, the Yellow Regiment of the late King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> This Place made a very brave Reſiſtance; and this Regiment refuſing to capitulate, ſuſtain'd ſeveral Aſſaults, and periſhed upon the Breach. But at laſt the Town was taken by force, and all of them put to the Sword. It coſt the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts very dear; but the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> ſuſtained an irrepairable Loſs by it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> joyn'd the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> after this. This latter, although he was a <hi>Lutheran,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The 27th of <hi>July.</hi>
                  </note> gave him the Right-hand, becauſe he rather conſidered the great credit he was in with the Miniſter of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. than his Dignity of Cardinal. All the World wonder'd that the King, who did not want Generals, and kept a Mareſchal in Priſon, wou'd have recourſe to an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, to command one of his Armies, at ſo dangerous a Juncture; for in ſhort, whatever Inclinations the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> had to the profeſſion of War, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he came infinitely ſhort of ſeveral Commanders whom his Majeſty might have employ'd. But it was one of the Miniſter's Maxims, To employ Biſhops and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54967:72"/>Abbots in things that had no relation to their Function, whether he had a greater eſteem for Eccleſiaſticks than he had for the Laity, or whether he thought they wou'd ſerve him with more punctuality.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Galas</hi> had beſieged <hi>Deuxponts,</hi> which place he had brought to ſurrender the next day, when he received Advice, that the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> were marching towards him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. Upon this News he drew off; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the haſte the <hi>French</hi> made, with the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> they cou'd not overtake him ſo as to give him Battel. However, they advanced by the ſide of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and obliged 14000 Imperialiſts to raiſe the Siege of that City,<note place="margin">The 5th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </note> which the Enemy had reduced to ſuch Extremities that they muſt have been forced to ſurrender in four or five days for want of Proviſions.</p>
               <p>A few days after, <hi>Galas</hi> having re-united all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Forces that were about the <hi>Rhine</hi> into one Body, he formed an Army of them conſiſting of 30000 Men; and finding himſelf ſuperiour in numbers to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and the Duke, obliged them to retire in their turn. But it was impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt longer in the place where they were, by reaſon that <hi>Francford</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the Emperour, and Sickneſſes having got into the Army, had leſſen'd it conſiderably. Now the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was, how to make a ſafe Retreat, before an Army much ſtronger than their own: They made an account to march ſtraight to <hi>Sarbruck,</hi> and to <hi>St. Avaud,</hi> where there was plenty of Proviſions; but <hi>Galas</hi> having cut off that way from them, they muſt reſolve to take that of the Mountains, although un-peopled and without Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and endeavour to reach <hi>Vaudervange,</hi> where there was a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon. They took this Road, labouring under all theſe Inconveniences, without daring to make a Halt at any place, either by reaſon of the great want of Victuals, or out of fear of having <hi>Galas</hi> upon their hands, this General following them very cloſely. At laſt they arrived, on the 26th of <hi>September,</hi> at <hi>Vaudervange,</hi> without any other loſs than that of their Artillery, which the bad Weather, and the ſwiftneſs of their March, obliged them to leave behind. The ſame day they paſſed the <hi>Save,</hi> and this Precaution was not unſerviceable to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54967:72"/>them; for <hi>Galas</hi> appeared on the other ſide, four hours after. He likewiſe paſſed it on the 28th, and found that the <hi>French</hi> had abandoned their Baggage, to retire under the Cannon of <hi>Metz.</hi> He advanc'd within a League and half of this City; but finding the Enemy ſecure, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his Army back again into the Country of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> within ſome Leagues of that place. He had fifteen thouſand Foot, eight thouſand Horſe, and ſix thouſand <hi>Croats.</hi> The Cardinal and the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> had no more than eight thouſand Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, with a Body of Men under his Command, to re-poſſeſs himſelf of his Dominions, where ſome of his Subjects received him with great joy: But as all the ſtrong Places were in the King's hands, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to make any progreſs, by reaſon of the great Oppoſition he found from the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Angoulême.</hi> And thus after ſome Incurſions, and a few Skirmiſhes, he retired to joyn himſelf to <hi>Galas.</hi>

               <p>To come now to the Affairs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ever ſince the beginning of the Year the Cardinal was ſenſible, that the Maxim which he had obſerv'd till then, of not break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing openly with <hi>Spain,</hi> wou'd be for the future diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to <hi>France,</hi> ſince ſhe was not at a much leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to ſupport her Allies, than if ſhe had been in an open War, and yet made no advances againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> On the Contrary, ſhe had given them an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity by this means to joyn their Forces with thoſe of the Emperour in 1634, which made them gain the Battle of <hi>Norlingue,</hi> and had like to have entirely ruin'd the affairs of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> ſeveral Cities and Princes that furniſhed the <hi>Sweedes</hi> with conſiderable Supplies, had thought of nothing ever ſince, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Peace with the Emperour, leaſt they ſhould be in a ſhort time irreparably overthrown, if they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to oppoſe him with ſo much diſadvantage. The States General of the United Provinces, weary of the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which had laſted ſo many years, and fearing to be abandon'd by <hi>France,</hi> that wou'd never be brought to declare it ſelf, expreſs'd a great inclination to reaſſume the Negotiation of a Truce, which had been broken off, out of an Apprehenſion, that the Emperour after he had given Peace to <hi>Germany,</hi> wou'd do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the ſame kindneſs they had done him, that is to ſay, come with a formidable Army into the Low-Countries, to help them to re-conquer the Seven Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which had with-drawn themſelves from their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54967:75"/>If it ſo happen'd that a Peace was concluded in <hi>Germany,</hi> and a Truce in the Low-Countries, or that the United Provinces were ſubdu'd, then <hi>France,</hi> which was not in an open Rupture, either with the Emperour or the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> might ſee theſe Treaties concluded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being comprehended in them, becauſe the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would be in ſo advantageous a poſture at that time, what ſhe thought fit to command, muſt not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; and Matters being ſo, <hi>France,</hi> which had ſo long aſſiſted the Enemies of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> had no reaſon to doubt that all her Forces wou'd pour down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her.

               <p>For theſe Reaſons, the Cardinal thought it the beſt way to prevent the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in declaring open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> to hinder her from aſſiſting the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and to give new Life and Vigour to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Swedes.</hi> To this end, he took great pains to form a League againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> both in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give her ſo much Buſineſs at home, that ſhe ſhou'd not have leiſuro to look abroad and interpoſe in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Germany.</hi>

The <hi>French</hi> were deſirous to find out the Enemy and fight him, fearing to loſe too much time in beſieging of places; and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> choſe rather to undertake the Siege of ſome Town, without hazarding a Battel. At this time the <hi>Dutch</hi> underſtood the manner of beſieging of Places bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> were fitter to give Battle.

Several Diſorders were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> imputed to the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> threw back again upon the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Some perſons were of opinion, that <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> was not ſorry to render the <hi>French</hi> odious by this, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Proviſions for which they had occaſion.</p>
               <p>Having at laſt form'd a Reſolution to attack <hi>Louvain</hi> they took <hi>Dieſt</hi> and <hi>Arſchot</hi> in their way, and marched directly towards <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> as if their Deſign had been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that City, purpoſely to draw the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> thither, who was at <hi>Louvain</hi> with his Army.

The Mareſchal <hi>de Brezé,</hi> naturally warm and haughty upon the ſcore of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law's great favour, proceeded ſo far as to give the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> ill Language, but the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> reconciled them; and <hi>Chatillon</hi> being afraid of diſpleaſing the Miniſter, diſſembled his Anger more than he wou'd have done, upon another occaſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> accuſed the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to have been the Cauſe of all this Miſchief, by his Slowneſs and want of Reſolution, which had made them loſe an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of acting with Succeſs, and mightily impaired the Army. The <hi>Dutch</hi> on the other hand reproached the <hi>French</hi> Generals with diſagreeing among themſelves, and obſerving no order in their Troops. Abundance of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagined that <hi>Frederick-Henry,</hi> who was never ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to want Reſolution in his Life, feared that the <hi>French</hi> made too great a progreſs in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and that the States thought it more adviſable to have the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their Neighbours than the <hi>French.</hi> And in truth it was much better for them, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhou'd keep what they had in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> becauſe the great diſtance of their different Dominions wou'd hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from acting with the ſame Vigour againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> as the <hi>French,</hi> if they became their Neighbours, and afterwards their Enemies, might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy againſt them. 'Tis likewiſe ſaid, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army never wanted Proviſions all the while, and that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> if he had been ſo pleaſed, might have eaſily furniſhed the <hi>French;</hi> but that having no other Deſign than merely to engage <hi>France</hi> in a War
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54967:77"/>with <hi>Spain,</hi> he did not care what Succeſs they found in the courſe of it; and that for this reaſon he always ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd their Army to periſh.</p>
               <p>However it was, there happen'd to him, much about the ſame time, an Accident of a much more dangerous conſequence, and that was the Surprizal of the Fort of <hi>Schenk,</hi> which is one of the Keys of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> It was ſurpriz'd by Colonel <hi>Eenholt,</hi> in the night, on the 27th or 28th of <hi>July:</hi> for it ſeems no care was taken to make neceſſary Reparation there, and then the Garriſon was very inconſiderable; ſo that after they had vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly oppoſed two Aſſaults of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they were cut off at the third. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> wou'd have fain got thither before the Enemy had thrown any more Men into the place, and begg'd the French Mareſchals to aſſiſt him; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made ſuch haſte to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it with Men and Proviſions, that he arrived too late, and he judg'd it was impoſſible to reduce it by force. So he undertook to make himſelf Maſter of the Fort by Famine, and block'd it up almoſt a whole Year before it ſurrender'd. Several Rencounters happen'd between the two Armies near this Fort; but there was no deciſive Action. Afterwards the Cardinal-Infanta went to fortifie <hi>Genap,</hi> by the means of which place he greatly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded the Garriſons of <hi>Venlo, Ruremonde,</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the World was ſurprized, that an Army of forty thouſand Men, as was that of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> durſt not attack that of the Cardinal-Infanta, which had but half the number, and was ſtill diſheartned by the Defeat of <hi>Avein.</hi>

The King, who was made at firſt to expect Miracles from this great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, was mightily concerned that it ſucceeded ſo ill, although care was taken to conceal a great part of their Loſſes from him.

At laſt they were ordered to ſave the reſt of the Army as well as they cou'd, but eſpecially the Horſe. <hi>Charnacé</hi> who came from the Army to <hi>Paris,</hi> was ordered to return into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to endeavour to conduct it from thence.</p>

Every one was to maintain his own Troops till the End of the War; and in caſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> augmented the number of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Confederates were to raiſe a fourth part more than they had before. It was concluded, that the Duke
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54967:78"/>of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſhou'd command the Army, and in his Abſence the General of the French Forces; which Station was to be poſſeſſed by the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi.</hi> They had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe agreed about the Diviſion of the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> if it ſhou'd be conquered.</p>
               <p>After this League was ſigned,<note place="margin">Siri, <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 292.</note> the Mareſchal entred into the Territories of <hi>Spain</hi> on the 29th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> with the French Troops; and having taken ſome inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Places, he went to inveſt <hi>Valence,</hi> upon the <hi>Po,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Orders from the King, or the Duke of <hi>Savoy. Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> took the Field the next day, aſſiſted by an experienc'd French Captain, whoſe name was <hi>de la Marne,</hi> whom Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> had ſent to direct him. He joyned him ſoon after, after he had routed a ſmall Body of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that pretended to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his March. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made a longer ſtay before he came to the Rendezvouz; and as the Siege of <hi>Valence</hi> was not as yet perfectly formed, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had an opportunity to throw four thouſand Men into the Town, commanded by the Marquiſs <hi>de Celada,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce the Garriſon. <hi>Francis del Cardine</hi> was Governour of this place, aſſiſted by Captain <hi>Spadini,</hi> a Man of great Courage and Conduct.</p>
               <p>After this, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſent his Troops to the Camp, and the Mareſchal began to carry on the Siege. he imagined that he ſhou'd be able to carry the Place in a few days, although the Beſieged ſallied out continually, and added ſome new Works to the ancient Fortifications. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Men, who had never been in any War before, daily diminiſhed; and as for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he made ſome difficulty of going in Perſon to this Siege, as being undertaken againſt his Advice, and begun by another. The Mareſchal <hi>de Thoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> out of Envy to <hi>Crequi,</hi> diſſwaded him from going thither; but at laſt, at the Inſtances of <hi>Emery,</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Turin,</hi> he arrived at the Camp on the 13th of <hi>October;</hi> and after he had viſited the Works, he was of opinion that the Siege wou'd come to nothing; and in truth this unhappy Miſunderſtanding between them ruined all their Deſigns.</p>
               <p>The Mareſchal having received Advice that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Army, commanded by Don <hi>Carlo Colonna,</hi> was on
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54967:79"/>their March to endeavour to raiſe the Siege, ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Duke to order his Men to paſs the <hi>Po,</hi> that ſo they might fight the Enemy before they were intrenched at <hi>Freſcarolo.</hi> But the Troops of the Duke paſſed ſo ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were forced to ſend them back the next day. It was ſtill believed, that it wou'd be their beſt way to go and attack the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> ſo the Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward, the Mareſchal being in the Vanguard, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Body of the Battel, and the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> in the Rear. The Enemy had taken no care to entrench themſelves, thinking that the French durſt not ſtir out of their Lines to meet an Army ſtronger than their own, and they began already to retire when they were attacked. <hi>Crequi</hi> had the Right, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> commanded on the Left: The Attack began on the Duke's ſide with a great deal of Vigour, although they had not ſent to obſerve the ground where the Enemy lay. They were beaten back into the Vineyards, where their Infantry was poſted, and they diſputed the ground very weakly, when <hi>Crequi,</hi> upon a falſe Information, ſent word to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were entrenched on the other ſide, and ſuperiour to them in number, upon which he did not think it ſafe to puſh it on any farther. This occaſioned <hi>Victor-Amadeo,</hi> who had already diſlodged the Spaniſh Infantry out of the Vineyards, to ſound a Retreat, and loſe a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of beating the Enemy. It is reported, that <hi>Crequi</hi> ſuſpected that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> only deſigned to engage him, to ſuffer him afterwards to be cut in pieces, and that for this reaſon he did not attack them. He retired likewiſe at the ſame time, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon themſelves as good as beaten, were ſurprized to ſee the Enemy abandon, of their own accord, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize which had begun ſo well. This News they learn'd of the Priſoners, but then it was too late; for after this the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entrenched themſelves, and were always upon their Guard. Nor was this all; for they threw freſh Succours into the City through a place where the Lines of Circumvallation were not compleated, and where the <hi>Savoyards</hi> did not make any manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Another Supply enter'd the Town by the <hi>Po,</hi> after which the Rains that uſually fall in the Autumn,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54967:79"/>incommoded the Beſiegers. The Army which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe exceedingly weakned, by Weakneſſes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and the mutual jealouſies between the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> ſtill increaſing, they began to talk of raiſing the Siege, as they did the next day, leaving their Canon, and part of their Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. The Generals drew off, complaining one of another, and that the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> which they had wiſely ſhared between themſelves before-hand, ſtill continued in the Hands of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal who had believed the Conqueſt of it to be a matter of ſmall Difficulty, was exceedingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at the ill ſucceſs of this enterprize, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal Accuſations of the Duke and the Mareſchal, which afterwards came to him, gave him but little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. <hi>Crequi</hi> accuſed the Duke with holding private Intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Duke made it appear that the Mareſchal had undertaken this Siege with too ſmall an Army, and ſhow'd no Conduct in the whole Affair, whatever Bravery he might otherwiſe have.</p>
               <p>He that was the moſt in Danger, was the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> whoſe Territories lay expoſed to the revenge of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He complain'd that he was the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that had obſerved the Treaty, both in regard to the number of his Troops, the time appointed, and to his Zeal in executing with Vigour the projects that had been concerted in the Council of War. To prevent the ruine of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and fruſtrate the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Troops of <hi>France</hi> took their Winter Quarters in <hi>Italy,</hi> and were diſtributed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Garriſons.</p>
               <p>Thus the Cardinal's great Expectations of conquering the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> vaniſh'd on the ſudden, although 'tis certain that he cou'd not have choſen a fitter time for this enterprize, if it had been well executed, for the King had made himſelf Maſter of the Paſſes of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline</hi> beforchand, to hinder any Troops from coming to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Germany.</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54967:80"/>into the <hi>Valteline,</hi> in order to poſſeſs himſelf of that Country, and to defend it with the Forces, which were there already.

Soon after, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> arrived there, and began to work upon the Fortifications of thoſe Poſts which they had ſeized.

                  </note> To ſupport the expences of the War, the King was obliged to create abundance of new Officers, and every Parliament according to the extent of its juriſdiction, was conſtrained to receive a certain number of Preſidents and Counſellors, who bought theſe places of the King. Upon this, the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> had a meeting, and reſolved to make a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance to His Majeſty upon this augmentation, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of hearkening to them, the King baniſhed ſome of the Councellors to <hi>Angers</hi> and <hi>Ambois,</hi> for talking too boldly. The New Chancellor fell into a great Rage at the Parliament, telling them, That it did not belong to them to cenſure the King's Conduct, and that their Authority reach'd no higher than to ſee the Laws duly obſerved, and to adminiſter juſtice to the People. The King likewiſe ſent <hi>La Ville aux-Clercs</hi> to forbid the Chambers to aſſemble, and to tell them that no Notice wou'd be taken of their Remonſtrances, till they had received the new Counſellors. They accordingly obey'd,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54967:81"/>and on the 17th of <hi>March,</hi> they obtain'd the return of thoſe that had been baniſhed, upon this Condition, that they would behave themſelves more dutiful for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, the King ſhut up his Treaſury as to all ſorts of expences, but thoſe for carrying on the War, ſo that the Governors of Provinces, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Crown, had been obliged to throw up their Places and Penſions, if there had not been a way found out to get them paid by the Kingdom; which for that reaſon, they burthen'd with new Impoſitions. Some of them rather choſe to remit them, than to ruine the poor People; but the greateſt part of them made uſe of this Expedient, to ſatisfie themſelves for what was owing to them, which excited great Clamours and Diſcontents.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter did not much trouble himſelf what the World thought of theſe exactions, ſo long as they brought in Money.

               <p>The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> gave another Mortification to the Cardinal this Year, for the Ciſtercian <hi>Monks</hi> and the <hi>Premonſtratenſes</hi> having elected him to be their Abbot General, the <hi>Pope</hi> refuſed to grant him the Bulls. He was already Abbot of <hi>Cluny,</hi> who is chief of the Order, and conſequently Abbot General of the <hi>Benedictines,</hi> ſo that if he had procur'd this, he had been the Head of the three richeſt Orders of the Kingdom. It was alledged in his Favour, that theſe Orders ſtanding in need of a Reformation, for this end they ought to have a perſon of great Authority ſet over them, as the Cardinal was. But they were well ſatisfied at <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was his deſire to Rule and not to Reform, that induced him to demand this Benefice. Had he ſucceeded in this affair, beſides a vaſt Revenue, he had found a great Number of Monks depending wholly upon him, ready to concur with him in all his inclinations, either to obtain Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are in the Collation of the General of theſe Orders, or to teſtifie their acknowledgments to him after they had once obtained them. It was likewiſe feared, that he wou'd endeavour to get himſelf declared Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch in <hi>France,</hi> or at leaſt Legate <hi>à Latere</hi> for all his Life, after the example of Cardinal <hi>d' Amboiſe,</hi> and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Proſpect, he wou'd uſe his Intereſt to exempt the Monks and Secular Prieſts, from any farther depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Court, by the means of his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which the King always diſpoſed of upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.</p>
               <p>If the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did not ſhow him that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance which he deſired, it was not to be imagined that he wou'd give them any Satisfaction, as to what they demanded of him. Ever ſince the laſt year, it had been reſolved upon to ſend the Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtrées,</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to <hi>Rome,</hi> although the Pope ſhew'd a mighty unwillingneſs to receive him, and had teſtified ſo much to the Court of <hi>France.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this oppoſition, the Mareſchal parted towards the<note n="*" place="margin">

This was the principal reaſon of the Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtree</hi>'s Embaſſy, with whom the Pope refuſed a long while to treat, becauſe he ſeem'd to have deſpiſed his Authority when he ſeized upon the <hi>Valteline,</hi> as has been obſerved elſewhere. It was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pretended, that by his rough Behaviour he had been the death of <hi>Paul</hi> V. However, the Cardinal, who was not uſed to ſtart back from what he had once engaged in, did eſpouſe him ſo vigorouſly, that the Pope was forced at laſt to lay down his Pretenſions, and treat with him.</p>
               <p>He had Orders<note n="*" place="margin">

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the perſon of this Capuchin was not very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope made a Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to confer the Purple upon a Capuchin, becauſe that the Cardinal of St. <hi>Honorio</hi> his Brother, who had been a Capuchin, pretended that he was the only perſon of his Order that enjoyed that Honour. The Pope inſiſted upon this, That after he had given a Cap to one Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, it wou'd be demanded for others of the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as was already done; and ſo that Body, which at preſent was ſo well regulated, wou'd be corrupted by ambitious Thoughts, with which abundance of Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins wou'd be poſſeſs'd, that wou'd begin to pretend to the chief Dignities of the Church. The Mareſchal was very liberal in his Commendations of Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but was not able to procure any thing in his favour; for the Pope ſtill perſiſted in the ſame Reaſons, whatever Arguments were brought to perſwade him to the contrary.</p>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> obtained leave of the King to command a ſmall Army, which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to furniſh him with, in Quality of his Majeſty's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> fortified themſelves in the places which they had taken in the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Country. The Marquiſs <hi>de Leganez,</hi> to whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had lately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Government of <hi>Milan,</hi> placed the principal Troops of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Novara,</hi> at <hi>Pavia,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in the Neighbourhood, and threw a Bridge over the <hi>Po</hi> at <hi>Girola,</hi> by which the three Bodies, into which their Army was divided, might have free Communication one with another, in order to hinder the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> from coming into the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Country. On the other ſide, after ſeveral hot Conteſts between the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who agreed no better this Campaign than they did the former, it was concluded to accompany the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to the Frontiers of his Dominions with the whole Army, and to lend him ſix thouſand Foot, and eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, to beat his Enemies out of it; and at the ſame time to fortifie themſelves upon the <hi>Teſin,</hi> and get <hi>Oleggio</hi> into their hands, that they might be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have a Communication with the Forces of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline.</hi> Several Difficulties aroſe in the execution of this Deſign, occaſion'd by the Miſunderſtanding of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Neglect to furniſh the Army with a ſufficient number of Boats to paſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; ſo that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had underſtood Military Affairs, they had more than once found an opportunity to ruin the Army of the Confederates: but they took the Irreſolutions and falſe Steps of the <hi>French,</hi> for ſo many Stratagems.</p>
               <p>At laſt they came before <hi>Oleggio</hi> the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> and the next day <hi>Crequi</hi> made himſelf Maſter of this place, which ſurrendred in an inſtant. Three hundred Horſe, that were ſent towards the <hi>Teſin</hi> to ſeize the Boats upon which they were to paſs, found that they were on the other ſide; but the <hi>French</hi> Commandant, who had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Carabineers of <hi>Montferrat</hi> to wear red Scarfs, made the Boatmen believe they were Troops in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Spain</hi> that were purſued by the <hi>French:</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by this Artifice perſwaded them to bring their Boats on his ſide, they ſoon made themſelves Maſters of them. By this Trick, and by the means of ſome other Boats, which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had commanded to be brought

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> marched at the ſame time to <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanct,</hi> which upon his Arrival he found to be ſtronger than he believed. <hi>Thoiras</hi> inveſted it, and ordered a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of four Pieces of Cannon to play upon the Town; but as he ſtood too near this Battery,<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mem. <hi>Rec.

He was exceedingly lamented by all people for his good Qualities, and for the eminent Services he had done the Kingdom. The Cardinal never loved him, becauſe the King had expreſſed an Inclination to make him his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite; and after he had ſent him into <hi>Italy,</hi> made the King jealous of him, becauſe two of his Brothers had been in <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Army at the Battel of <hi>Caſtelnaudarry.</hi> Nor was this all; for he got his Governments and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be taken from him, and gave the King ſuch a Character of him as he pleaſed, and the Mareſchal had not the means to defend himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontanct</hi> ſurrendred ſoon after, and the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> joyn'd the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> without any oppoſition, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had entirely abandoned all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the <hi>Teſin,</hi> thinking that the <hi>French</hi> had a Deſign to paſs the <hi>Tanare,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Po.</hi> The Duke and the Mareſchal continued together upon the Banks of the <hi>Teſin,</hi> one on one ſide, and the other on the other, till the 20th of this Month, in conſulting whether they ſhould ſend the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> back again to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The latter knew not himſelf what Meaſures to take; but at laſt, for fear an Army of his Friends ſhou'd ruine him, as well as that of his Enemies; he reſolved to part <hi>incognito,</hi> and in that manner, to get into his own Dukedom, through the Territories of <hi>Genoa.</hi> As he had no Experience in Military Affairs, he hop'd at firſt, that within a few Months, and without any great Expence, the Confederate Army would over-run all the <hi>Milaneze;</hi> but having ſeen the quite contrary happen, and his own ſtate in Danger to become the Theatre of the War, he wholly alter'd his Opinion, and became
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54967:84"/>fearful very unſeaſonably, as he had formerly ſuffered himſelf to be led away with ill grounded expectations.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Confederate Army marched on the two Banks of the <hi>Teſin,</hi> to fortifie ſome Poſt there, which they ſhould judge moſt advantageous to command that River, and to make a Bridge over it. In their march they received Advice that the Marquiſs <hi>de Leganez</hi> was coming towards them, on that ſide where <hi>Crequi</hi> was, ſo that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſet his Men to work all Night upon a Bridge, which was<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 23d <hi>of</hi> June.</note> ready by the next Morning, that he might joyn the Mareſchal. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had Fourteen Thouſand Foot, Four Thouſand Horſe, and Four Canon. They charged the <hi>French</hi> in the Morning, who ſuſtained the Shock till the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had paſſed the River. The Fight was ſo reſolutely maintain'd on both ſides, that it laſted till Night; the Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncertain all the Day, and the two Armies return'd ſeveral times to the Charge, and wou'd not give way. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> retir'd in the Night, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Mareſchal endeavoured in Vain to begin the Fight afreſh the next Day. All the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they got, was the Field of Battle, and the number of the Dead and Wounded on their Side was ſomewhat leſs. In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> forced ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſes above the Lake of <hi>Como,</hi> but when he was at <hi>Lech,</hi> he ſent word to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that he cou'd not advance further than <hi>Gravedonne,</hi> becauſe the ways were impracticable. Thus he was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> abandon'd the <hi>Teſin</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 23d <hi>of</hi> July.</note> went back to <hi>Turin.</hi> From that time the <hi>French</hi> Army began to diminiſh conſiderably by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual deſertions; and on the Contrary, the new Levies of the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> and of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> daily augmented that of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was no ſooner returned to his Dominions, but he ſaw a conſiderable Body of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops under Duke <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who ravaged and plundered the greateſt part of them. He then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented that he had not accepted the Forces that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him for the preſervation of his Country, which he was afraid of burthening too much by receiving them, and he ſent to demand them again with great earneſtneſs.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54967:84"/>But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being at that time Maſters of the Field, it was not an eaſie matter to relieve him. To compleat his Misfortunes, the Pope publiſhed a Monito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt the Duke, by which he cited him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and commanded him to recall the Troops which he had in the Territories of any other State. Beſides this, the Pope pretended to have Security in Writing, that he wou'd obey him in the ſpace of Thirty Days, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he threatned to excommunicate him, and give his Lands to the firſt Poſſeſſor, People were ſo much the more ſurprized at theſe rigorous Proceedings, becauſe at that time, the Duke had Soldiers no where but at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ravaged his Country at Pleaſure, and kept <hi>Placentia</hi> blocked up. The World was not then acquainted with the Myſtery, that there was a ſecret Treaty between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Barberini's,</hi> who deſired to make themſelves Maſters of this Prince's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, under any pretence whatever, and to put D. <hi>Taddeo Barberini,</hi> prefect of <hi>Rome,</hi> in poſſeſſion of them. The King ſent orders to the Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtrees,</hi> to complain highly of the Pope's Proceedings, and hinder'd him from puſhing on this Deſign any longer in publick. He likewiſe ordered the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> to ſuccour the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> with all Expedition, but the Paſſes being all ſhut up, as well through the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> as through the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> partly by the Troops that were poſted there, and partly by the Rains and badneſs of the Weather; the Mareſchal was not able to execute this Order, ſo that the beſt courſe the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> cou'd now take, was to make his Peace with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who being ſatisfied to ſee him humbled, did offer very reaſonable Conditions, of which the Pope, and the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> were to be the Guarrantees. But the Vexation to be ſo ſoon reduced to beg Pardon of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the great promiſes of <hi>France,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd this Prince not to liſten to thoſe that adviſed him to accommodate matters with <hi>Spain,</hi> although he was blocked up in <hi>Placentia,</hi> and 'twas now diſcourſed to beſiege that Place in the uſual Forms.</p>
               <p>Thus this Champaign ended in <hi>Italy</hi> not ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly for <hi>France</hi> as it had begun, and their Victories were ſcarce able to preſerve their Allies. The King
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54967:85"/>was reſolv'd to ſuccour thoſe places which he ſtill held in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> to ſecure them againſt the Imperialiſts, who endeavour'd to retake them, and hop'd to reduce them in a ſhort time, by reaſon of the great diſtance of the <hi>French.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who had ſerved his Apprenticeſhip the Year before in <hi>Germany,</hi>

However a little ſprinkling of Money among them, appeaſed thoſe that cryed out the loudeſt, and ſo this Deputation went away in Smoke. But the Inhabitants of <hi>Dole,</hi> although they were attack'd with a great deal of Bravery, defended themſelves beyond Expectation, and the place was in a Condition to hold out till the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> could come to relieve it.

The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> demanded Ten Thouſand Foot and Twelve Companies of Horſe for this Champaign; but inſtead of liſtening to theſe Offers, the other Deſigns which the Cardinal had on Foot, and the good and bad ſucceſs of which I I have related, made him in all probability neglect the neceſſary Preparations on that Side to oppoſe the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> And thus the States-General not being aſſiſted by <hi>France</hi> as they ought to have been, the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> was not apprehenſive of any great harm they could do him, and therefore directed his Thoughts to retaliate to <hi>France,</hi> what <hi>France</hi> had done to him the Year before. Beſides, ſeeing the principal Forces of <hi>France</hi> taken up in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> he thought it ſufficient to ſend the Count <hi>de Feria</hi> againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with a ſmall Army.</p>

After they had taken ſome other ſmall Places, they went to attack <hi>Catelet,</hi> which St. <hi>Leger</hi> who was the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it, ſurrendered likewiſe, without ſtaying till they had made a Breach. All People were ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the ſmall reſiſtance which the Governours of theſe Places made, and the Cardinal fell into an exceſſive rage againſt them, although it was purely his Fault; for the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy,</hi> even after the Declaration of the War, were left naked and unprovided, as if it had been in the midſt of a Peace. To turn the Eyes of the World from himſelf, he compoſed a Council of the Officers of the Crown that were at <hi>Paris,</hi> and of ſome Councellors of State, which condemned the Governors of the Places ſurrender'd, to be quartered like Traytors. Nay<note n="*" place="margin">See the Life of the Duke of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon. p. 548.</hi>
                  </note> he fell foul upon the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> becauſe he wou'd not give his Vote to have the Baron <hi>du Bec</hi> condemned to die, as the Intereſts of the Miniſter demanded.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:54967:87"/>
               <p>All they cou'd do at that juncture was, to oppoſe the Progreſs of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by a ſmall Body of Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> and compoſed of the Troops of the Mareſchal <hi>de Brezé</hi> which he had brought out of <hi>Holland,</hi> and of thoſe of the Mareſchal <hi>de Chaunes,</hi> who had acted the Summer before upon the Frontiers of <hi>Artois.</hi> But this Army being in no reſpect capable to make head againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and being alſo leſſen'd by the Detachments that were made out of it to defend thoſe Places which were in danger to be attack'd, they contented themſelves to diſpute the Paſſage of the River <hi>Somme</hi> with them, and to incommode their March. On the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army appeared upon the Banks of that River, and pretending to paſs over at a certain place by the favour of twelve Pieces of Cannon placed in Battery upon the Banks of the <hi>Somme,</hi> they paſſed it at another place where the <hi>French</hi> did not expect them. The Count was reſolved to attack their Infantry, who had with great haſte cover'd themſelves with Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but he ſuſtained ſo great a Loſs, without being able to diſlodge them, that he was obliged to yield the field to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to retire to <hi>Compeigne.</hi> This alarmed the whole Country, which was ſurprized to ſee that the Count ſhou'd fly before 8 or 10000 Horſe, which <hi>Piccolomini</hi> and <hi>Jean de Werth</hi> commanded. Thus <hi>Roye</hi> the next day open'd their Gates to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, and the <hi>French</hi> Troops every where began to be poſſeſs'd with a great Conſternation. It was feared, that as they fled towards <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army wou'd purſue them, whereas had they taken any Poſt that lay nearer to the Frontiers, the Enemies durſt not have advanced too far into the Kingdom. Within a few days after, <hi>Corbie,</hi> which paſs'd for a ſtrong place, was taken, after a Siege of 8 days, although there were 1800 Men in Garriſon there. <hi>Soyccourt,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Province, ſurrendred it, without ſtaying till it was aſſaulted, or fearing the Puniſhment to which the other Governours were condemned.</p>
               <p>At this time the <hi>Pariſians</hi> were in an extraordinary fear, notwithſtanding the King's preſence among them, and the perpetual Arrival of new Troops, which daily encreaſed the Army. Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was curſed in all

Lib. 5. Cap. 38.</note> It was not only ſaid, that War was not his Profeſſion, but they added, that he had a Deſign to deliver up <hi>Paris</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that for that reaſon he had cauſed the Walls of the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of St. <hi>Honore</hi> to be broken down, under a Pretence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the City on that ſide. However,<note n="†" place="margin">Aubery Ibid. c. 40. <hi>Siri,</hi> Ibid. p. 438.</note> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe Murmurs againſt him, the Cardinal being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> went into the City, without his ordinary Guards, as it were to hearten the People, and to let them ſee how ſecure he thought himſelf upon the ſcore of his Innocence.</p>
               <p>All the Companies of <hi>Paris</hi> went to offer their Service to the King upon this occaſion; and they aſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to raiſe new Levies with all Expedition. All the young Fellows about the City that were capable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms, were ſent for. Thoſe that had ſeveral Lackeys were obliged to ſend one, as well as the Tradeſmen that had Apprentices to ſpare; and ſeveral Buildings at <hi>Paris</hi> were laid aſide for the preſent, to liſt the Carpenters and Maſons. The King likewiſe put out an Order, that all thoſe that had above one pair of Coach-Horſes ſhould give one, to ſerve for the Artillery or Troopers; and that all Gentlemen, and all thoſe that were exempt from Taxes, and all the Officers of his Houſhold, ſhould repair in their Arms to St. <hi>Denys</hi> within ſix days. In the mean time the Siege of <hi>Dole</hi> was raiſed, as has been already obſerved, and the King, on the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> found himſelf at the Head of forty thouſand Foot, and twelve thouſand Horſe, and with a Train of forty Pieces of Cannon.</p>
               <p>The Army being met together, His Majeſty came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, accompanied by <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the Cardinal-Duke, the Duke of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> and the Mareſchals <hi>de la Force,</hi> and <hi>Chatillon,</hi> beſides abundance of other Officers. <hi>Monſieur</hi> was declared Generaliſſimo of that Army, and the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> Lieutenant-General; which was rather done for fear of diſcontenting thoſe Princes, than obliging
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54967:88"/>them. The Cardinal deſired to be Generaliſſimo, and that the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> might Command under him; but the Count-refuſed it; and ſo he was obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that Poſt upon <hi>Monſieur,</hi> which he deſired for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Although they were now in a condition to beat the Enemies out of <hi>Picardy</hi> ſo ſoon as they pleaſed, yet the Danger they had been in, and the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> threw the King into ſo deep a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was diſpleaſed at every thing. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that his Brother had the Command of the Army, and that he lived in a good Underſtanding with the Count <hi>de Soiſſons.</hi> He expreſs'd a great Coldneſs towards the Cardinal, for daring to cenſure his ill Humour, and his want of Reſolution. He wou'd ſcarce be brought to ſee him, and he contradicted him whenever he ſpake of any thing; ſo that the Cardinal loſt in a manner all his Courage, and neglected to give the neceſſary Orders. It was obſerved, that contrary to his cuſtom, he ſhew'd a great deal of Civility to thoſe people whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſlighted.

But this Capuchin having inſpired him with freſh Reſolution by his Diſcourſes, he determined to apply himſelf more than ever to Publick Affairs.</p>
               <p>The firſt Thing he adviſed His Majeſty in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture was, to perſwade the States-General to make ſome Attempts upon the Territories of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was willing enough, but thoſe that promoted the Treaty hinder'd him from acting with neceſſary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. However, he gain'd his point of them at laſt, and forbad the State's Agent at <hi>Vienna</hi> to talk any more of a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54967:88"/>Truce. He took the field with a conſiderable Army, and was ready to make a Diverſion in the <hi>Spaniſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> in caſe the Count <hi>de Feria</hi> approached the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>France.</hi> 'Twas at this time that <hi>Frederick-Henry</hi> received the Title of <hi>Highneſs,</hi> which the Cardinal gave him inſtead of that of <hi>Excellence,</hi> which he had till then enjoy'd. The King concluded a new Treaty with the States, by which he promiſed them a Million and half of Livers, to be paid at Three ſeveral Payments in a year; upon condition that all this Money ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in carrying on the War againſt <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To encourage the Army by his Preſence, the King ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, as I have already ſaid, at the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and having advanced as far as <hi>Senlis,</hi> from whence he beheld one night the Flame of ſome Villages, which the <hi>Croatians</hi> had ſet on fire before they left them, he fell a Weeping at the Loſſes and Calamities of his People. But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army being utterly unable to oppoſe the progreſs of the Royal Forces, thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now but retiring into the Low-Countries, becauſe they had not time enough to ſecure their Conqueſts. Thus the Army of <hi>France</hi> came before <hi>Roye,</hi> and after this Place had been Batter'd for a few days, by Twelve Pieces of Canon, they ſurrendred to <hi>Monſieur</hi> by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Afterwards it Marched to Block up <hi>Corbie,</hi> for there was no hopes of taking it by force. To effect this, they undertook to environ it with Forts, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, for fear leaſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould Relieve it; but they were informed ſoon after, that the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wanted Corn, and other Proviſions. This made the Cardinal reſolve to propoſe the Attacking of the place, hoping that the Garriſon, weakned by want and ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would be obliged to Capitulate. The Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> was the firſt that propoſed it in a Council; and this Advice, ſupported by the Authority of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, carried it from that of the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> who believed, it would be impoſſible to reduce this place by force, at that time of the year. They made Three Attacks, and the Garriſon finding themſelves deſtitute of Victuals, and no hopes of a Relief, Capitulated on the 19th of <hi>November.</hi>

The Miniſter was of opinion, that the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> who was of an imperious haughty temper, would fall out with <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and that their Domeſticks, whoſe Intereſts were different, would take care to incenſe them one againſt another. But it fell out quite contrary, for theſe two Princes, who had been Enemies of a long ſtanding to his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, re-united more than ever to ruine him. They were made to believe, that if they ſtill continued in their deſigns againſt the Miniſter, they would draw to their party the Houſes of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> of <hi>Vendome,</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpernon,</hi> and of <hi>Rets,</hi> whom he had ſcurvily uſed, and who appeared to be very much diſſatisfy'd with him. So <hi>Monſieur</hi> and the Count being at <hi>Peronne,</hi> they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed together about the propereſt ways to deſtroy the Cardinal. Some were of opinion, That His Majeſty ſhould be made acquainted with the Ill-conduct of this Miniſter, who was the cauſe of all the Calamities the Nation groaned under; and that he had engaged him in a War, which he vainly imagined he was able to manage of himſelf, though he was much fitter to raiſe a Cruel War in the State, than to repel Foreigners. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers adviſed to diſpatch him out of the way, for that would ſoon put an end to all theſe diſorders: This laſt expedient ſeemed the beſt, and the two Princes being reſolved to put it in execution, truſted the Secret with four perſons, one of whom was a Domeſtick of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi> and the other three belonged to the Count <hi>de Soiſſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the Siege of <hi>Corbie,</hi> the King Lodged in a Caſtle near <hi>Amiens,</hi> and never came to the City, where the Cardinal lay, but when he held a Council there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he returned to this Caſtle. So <hi>Monſieur</hi> and the Count reſolved, one day when they came to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to carry a great number of the Officers of the Army
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54967:89"/>along with them, and that ſo ſoon as the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Quarters, to find ſome pretence or other to ſtop the Cardinal, and cauſe him to be Murder'd by the Four Men, who knew of the Affair. With this deſign they came to the City, and the Council being over, the King retired according to his Cuſtom. One of the Four Conſpirators coming up to the Duke and the Count, as if he had ſomething to ſay to them, asked in their Ear, Whether they ſtill continued in this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? They anſwer'd, Yes: So this Man made a Sign for the others to approach, at the time when the two Princes were diſcourſing with the Cardinal at the bottom of the Stair-caſe of the Council-Chamber. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remained for the Duke to doe, but onely to give theſe Fellows the Signal, and then the Cardinal had been certainly kill'd, without any poſſibility of eſcaping. But at this moment the Duke leaving the Cardinal with the Count, began to go up the Stairs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Hall in a great confuſion: One of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators immediately followed him, and would have pulled him back, but the Duke never ſtopt till he was got up to the top.</p>
               <p>It was to no purpoſe for this Man to repreſent to him, That he had loſt the faireſt opportunity in the World, and that nothing had been ſo eaſie as to accompliſh it: The Duke was ſo ſtrangely diſorder'd, that he could make him no poſitive Anſwer, but expreſſed himſelf in confuſed and doubtful Terms. The Count ſtill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Cardinal in Converſation; one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators being behind him, and the other two at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance off; but <hi>Monſieur</hi> not returning, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal began to fear there was ſome deſign againſt his Perſon; and taking his leave of the Count, got into his Coach, and went home. He did not know till ſome time after, the circumſtances of the danger he had been in; but from that moment he would never truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more in the hands of his Enemies. Theſe Princes afterwards pretended, That when they were upon the point of having him Aſſaſſinated, they were hinder'd from doing it, by conſidering, that the Cardinal was a Prieſt: a weak Reaſon to put by the Execution of a Lawful Deſign, if this was one, and which did not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54967:90"/>the Crime much more heinous, if they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this action to be a crime, as really it was. Beſides, it was not at that very Moment when they deſign'd to kill the Cardinal, that they firſt learnt he was a Prieſt: no, they knew that long before; and if that reaſon was good, it ought to have diſſwaded them at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from falling upon ſuch a Deſign. But thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had engaged theſe Princes in this Affair, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted this ſudden change to the natural weakneſs of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> which rendred him equally uncapable of good and bad actions, when they required any force of Mind or Reſolution.</p>
               <p>Having failed of this blow, the Duke and the Count took the other way which had been propoſed, to ruin the Cardinal in the King's good opinion of him. To effect this more eaſily, they endeavour'd to engage the Dukes of <hi>Eſpernon, la Valette, Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Rets</hi> in their Deſign, and they ſent Meſſengers to them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but they onely diſcover'd their thoughts by this means, without ſtrengthening their party. The Cardinal who was inform'd of it, judged that the beſt way to ſupport himſelf againſt them, and to be revenged of 'em, was to remove them from the Court, by making falſe Advice be given them, That the King deſign'd to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. Thus being gone to <hi>Paris</hi> by the King's Order, on the 18th of <hi>November,</hi> while the Cardinal was ſtill in <hi>Picardy,</hi> he Alarm'd them ſo dexterouſly with this falſe news, that on the 20th, or 21ſt of <hi>November</hi> at Night, both of them made their Eſcapes. <hi>Monſieur</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Blois,</hi> without ſeeing the King, and the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> to <hi>Sedan,</hi> without taking his leave of him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had left the Court, it was no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter for the Cardinal to perſwade the King what he pleaſed; but when His Majeſty came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that theſe Princes gave it out publickly, That the reaſon of their going away, was, becauſe there was a deſign to apprehend them, he was extreamly offended at it; and, in reality, he had never thought of any ſuch thing. <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſent a very ſubmiſſive.<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>As for the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> who was of a more haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirit, he ſent the King a Letter full of Reproaches; wherein he complained, That, in ſtead of a Reward for the ſervices he had done him, he found himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to fly for Sanctuary to one of his Friends, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Impriſonment. However, the King was not much offended at his complaints, and ſent him word, That he had not the leaſt intentions to have him apprehended; and that if he had left the Kingdom merely out of fear, he would conſent that he ſhould tarry where he was, and that he ſhould enjoy all his Revenues and Penſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would behave himſelf like an obedient Subject.</p>

He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſired, that <hi>Du Fargis, Coudrai-Montpenſier,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>la Riviere,</hi> who had lately been ſent to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould be ſet at liberty. This, though it was not wholly refuſed, yet they intimated to him, that it would be much more proper to ask theſe Favours of the King, after he had entirely adjuſted all differences with him. The Abbot of <hi>la Riviere</hi> indeed was ſoon after releaſed from his Confinement, becauſe he promiſed to joyn with <hi>Goulas,</hi> the Duke's Secretary, who was of the Cardinal's Party, to perſwade <hi>Monſieur</hi> to doe what the Miniſter deſired of him. As for a place of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they thought it by no means fitting to grant him one; and, unleſs they granted that, the Duke was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they would not keep their words with him. Some of his Domeſticks put that into his head, as alſo to ſtick firm to the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> from whoſe Intereſts the Court endeavoured to diſengage him. As he was naturally inconſtant and irreſolute, he ſometimes ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inclin'd to make his own Agreement by himſelf; yet Writ at the ſame time to the Count, who had invited him to <hi>Sedan,</hi> that he deſign'd to come and joyn him. But at laſt the Offers of the Court, and the Advice of thoſe about him that favour'd it, determined him, for ſome time, to make his Reconciliation without the Count, and to feign himſelf ſick of the Gout, that he might not go to <hi>Sedan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time ſeveral of thoſe perſons who had been in the party of <hi>Puilaurens,</hi> came to <hi>Blois,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Court increaſed every day. The Dukes of <hi>Vendome</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi> came thither in private to offer their Services to him, and the D. of <hi>Beaufort</hi> engaged to conduct him ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where-ever he would be pleaſed to go. The Cardinal
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54967:91"/>fearing leſt this Prince might be prevailed upon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Mind, by the ſuggeſtions of thoſe that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, adviſed His Majeſty to diſpatch Orders to all the Governours of the Provinces and Towns about <hi>Blois,</hi> to have an eye upon all the Paſſes, and ſtop him, in caſe he attempted to go farther, till they had freſh Inſtructions. Troops were poſted in ſeveral places for the ſame reaſon, and people were ſet at <hi>Blois</hi> to look after all <hi>Monſieur</hi>'s Motions, and ſend advice of all that happen'd.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1637</label> Ever ſince the beginning of this year, the Court was informed by <hi>Chavigny,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> who were ſent expreſly to <hi>Blois,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> continued to demand a place of Security, ſuch as <hi>Blaye, Blavet,</hi> or <hi>Nantes.</hi> The Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> demanded the ſame for himſelf, before he would return to Court, and named <hi>Verdun,</hi> or <hi>Stenay.</hi> The Duke ſupported this demand of the Count, whom he ſeem'd willing enough to abandon before; and ſent <hi>Chaudebonne</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> to demand farther for himſelf, and enlargement of all his Domeſticks: that after a General Peace they ſhould pay all his Debts; that, for the preſent, they ſhould pay him down all thoſe Sums they had promiſed him, and allow him a Hundred thouſand Crowns towards ſome Buildings he was then about; that they ſhould not queſtion any of his ſervants, or of the Count <hi>de Soiſſons;</hi> that he might reſide where he pleaſed; and that they would aſſign him out of the Treaſury a Penſion for the Maintenance of Madam, ſo ſoon as ſhe ſhould come into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King and Cardinal looked upon theſe Pretenſions of <hi>Monſieur</hi> to be extravagant, eſpecially what related to the Places of Security, which they thought theſe Princes demanded for no other reaſon, but to be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, upon the firſt occaſion of Diſcontent they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to receive, to introduce the Enemies of the Crown into the Bowels of <hi>France.</hi> So they were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the King enlarged the Chevalier <hi>de Grignan</hi> out of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> who had a great Aſcendant over <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi> hoping that when he was near his Perſon, he might counter-balance the Credit of thoſe who perſwaded him to demand a place of ſecurity. They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54967:92"/>at Court, that <hi>Monſieur</hi> was ſo effectually led by the inſtigation of others, that they did not queſtion but that if thoſe that were about him would adviſe him to put himſelf into the King's hands, without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Stipulations, he would immediately come and do it.</p>
               <p>About the middle of <hi>January</hi> they ſent him word, That His Majeſty would grant him all the Securities he could deſire, but that he was willing to ſee an end of this Affair. Upon this <hi>Monſieur</hi> diſpatched F. <hi>Gondran,</hi> his Confeſſor, to Court, with demands like thoſe he had made before. They diſcover'd plainly by this, that he onely endeavour'd to gain time to make his eſcape to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> to which place the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> ſought all manner of ways to draw him, and that perhaps they waited till the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to act in their favour. So the Cardinal adviſed the King to go to <hi>Orleans</hi> in Perſon with His Guards, to put an end to this buſineſs, but he thought in the beſt way to ſend before-hand to <hi>Sedan,</hi> to the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> a<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See it in</hi> Aubery'<hi>s</hi> Mem.

The Count anſwered, That he would leave that matter to the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to act in it as he pleaſed; but refuſed to ſign the Writing, by which he ſhould engage himſelf to live in one of the worſt Towns in the Kingdom. 'Tis probable the Cardinal made him the offer of that City, purpoſely to make him refuſe it, that ſo he might not make his peace with the King ſo ſoon, for he hated him as much as he deſpiſed the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> when he had no body to adviſe him. The Miniſter who put the ſame Sentiments into the King's Head, about both the Princes, perſwaded him, upon the receipt of this Anſwer, to employ his Authority to make an end ſpeedily with <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and to leave the Count, for ſome time, out of the Kingdom. So the King's departure for <hi>Orleans</hi> was fixed on the 25th of <hi>January,</hi> and he was to carry along with him the <hi>French</hi>

               <p>After ſome Negotiations, <hi>Monſieur</hi> obtain'd a promiſe of the King, that he wou'd not paſs beyond <hi>Orleans;</hi> but upon the Cardinal's<note n="*" place="margin">The 31ſt of <hi>January.</hi>
                  </note> Arrival thither, the Duke was ſo terribly affrighted, that all that he inſiſted upon amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to this, that they wou'd not apprehend him when he came to <hi>Orleans.</hi> The King<note n="†" place="margin">Aubery'<hi>s Mem.</hi> T. 2. p. 19.</note> writ to him, to invite him to come and ſee him there, and gave him his Royal Word that he wou'd be ſo far from uſing him in that manner, <hi>That if after he had been with him he ſtill perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Inclinations to leave the Kingdom, he wou'd give him free leave to do it, with all the ſecurity he cou'd deſire.</hi> The Cardinal joyn'd a Billet to it, where he aſſured him, <hi>That he wou'd engage his life and his honour for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what the King was pleas'd to write to him.</hi> The Duke on his ſide ſign'd a new Oath of Fidelity at <hi>Blois,</hi> wherein he begged a Pardon for the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> and promiſed to renounce all manner of Friendſhip with him, if he behaved himſelf unworthy of the great favour his Majeſty had ſhewn him in giving him leave to enjoy his Eſtate, his Penſions, and his Offices, if he continued to act like an obedient Subject. Upon this the King made a ſort of a Declaration, wherein he promiſed to leave the Duke and the Count in the poſſeſſion of the above-mention'd Things, upon condition they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prejudicial to his Service.</p>

Even the Cardinal-Duke cou'd not forbear to rally him, though he made him abundance of Compliments. This Prince ſent to acquaint the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> with what had paſſed between the King and him, and to let him know, that if he had a mind to be comprehended in this Treaty, he had a Months time allow'd him to conſider of it; and that in caſe he accepted it, he might either ſtay in his Government of <hi>Champagne</hi> with all ſafety, or come back to Court.</p>

               <p>Although this Anſwer ſhew'd much more Reſolution than the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had expreſſed, yet the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> was not the worſe uſed for that.

               <p>The Count ſign'd theſe Articles, and took the Oath of Fidelity to the King, as was expreſly provided by the Treaty; after which he excuſed himſelf as well as he cou'd to the Queen-Mother and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> for not concluding that Affair which he had begun with the Cardinal-Infanta.

               <p>The Attempt which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made upon <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi> towards the end of the ſame Summer,<note n="†" place="margin">

Count <hi>Serbellon</hi> at the Head of Fourteen Thouſand Foot, and Fifteen Hundred Horſe, went to beſiege <hi>Leucate,</hi> on the laſt day of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> He attack'd it with a great deal of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, but the place being ſufficiently ſtrong, what by its Fortifications, and what by its natural Situation, <hi>Du Barry</hi> the Governour defended it ſo well, that the Duke of <hi>Hallain</hi> Governour of the Province, had time enough to come to the relief of it. Having preſently got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ten Thouſand Men of the Militia of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> brave fighting Fellows, and well ſeaſon'd in the Civil Wars, with Seven or Eight Hundred Horſe, of which he made a review at <hi>Narbonne</hi> the 22d of <hi>September,</hi> he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54967:95"/>marched four Days after in order of Battle, towards the Enemy's Camp. After he had taken a view of them, he reſolved to attack them on the 28th of the ſame Month, at the beginning of the Night. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> ſurprized to meet the Enemy without ſeeing them, and not knowing where to run, fell into a great Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, after they had made a feeble Oppoſition for a few Hours. At laſt they found there was no other way to ſave themſelves, but by abandoning their Camp, with all their Ammunition and Baggage, and the Night which furniſhed the Enemy with an opportunity to vanquiſh them, favoured their Flight. In Recompence of this brave Action and ſeveral other Services, the Duke of <hi>Hallain</hi> received a Mareſchal's Staff of <hi>France</hi> on the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> and was ever after, called the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> as his Father was.</p>
               <p>The ſame Day, the Mareſchal <hi>de Vitry</hi> Governour of <hi>Provence,</hi> with whom the Court was highly diſſatisfied, becauſe he had ruined their firſt enterprize upon the Iſles St. <hi>Honorat,</hi> and St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> was arreſted by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>de Gêores,</hi> and carried to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Provence</hi> 'was given at the ſame time to Count <hi>d' Alets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> did not only defend themſelves with a great deal of Succeſs in <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and turn the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of all thoſe Places they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but they attack'd them in the Low-Countries with ſufficient Advantages on their Side. The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Candalle</hi> his Brother, who had commanded a long while in the Service of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and was now returned into <hi>France;</hi> beſieged <hi>Landreci,</hi> a City of <hi>Henault,</hi> which<note n="*" place="margin">

From hence they marched to attack <hi>Capelle,</hi> and took it, through the Cowardice of the Governour, who did not give the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> time to relieve him, although he advanced by great Marches, with Fifteen Thouſand Men. He was not far off, when he heard that the Place was in the Hands of the <hi>French.</hi> The<note n="†" place="margin">Aubery'<hi>s Life of the</hi> Cardinal. Lib. 6.

He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54967:96"/>was reſolved to have it done this Year, and to be there himſelf in Perſon, but there appeared ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the attempt, which made the Cardinal diſſwade him from it, and propoſe the deſign of beſieging <hi>Aveſnes.</hi> In the mean time, as they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring all things to put it in Execution, twas believed their attempt upon that Place wou'd miſcarry, and for that reaſon they bethought themſelves to attack <hi>Capelle.</hi> The King was extreamly incenſed at their beſieging it, after they had diſſwaded him from it as being a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enterprize, as if they had envied him the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of reducing that Place. Nay, he was angry with the Cardinal, as if this Miniſter had deſigned to deceive him: But the Miniſter appeaſed him, by procuring an Atteſtation ſigned by the Officers of the Army; wherein they affirmed, that they had reſolved upon this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize in the ordinary Forms, finding the opportunity to be favourable to them, and not at all by the Cardinal's Order.</p>
               <p>At this time, the Miniſter found out the Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which the Queen had kept with the Dutcheſs <hi>de Chevrouſe,</hi> a diſcarded Miſtreſs of the Cardinal, as 'tis reported, and ordered the Man to be apprehended, by whoſe means ſhe managed this Commerce, as if the Queen had been obliged to give him an account of all thoſe, with whom ſhe had any manner of Concern. The Superiour of <hi>Val du Grace,</hi> who was accuſed to be in the intrigue, was likewiſe removed to another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Every thing that touched the Miniſter never ſo little, was a Crime againſt the State, and was puniſhed more ſeverely than what regarded the King's Perſon; but to return to the Affairs of War.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Mareſchal <hi>de Châtellon</hi> attack'd <hi>Yvoix,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and although it was defended with great Gallantry by Colonel <hi>Bronz,</hi> it was forced to ſurrender towards the end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> did not enjoy this Conqueſt long, for at the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> this place fell again into the Hands of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who made themſelves Maſters of it by ſurprize. This Loſs troubled the King exceedingly, and to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for it, the Mareſchal <hi>de Châtillon,</hi> whom the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the Marquiſs <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> had joyned,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54967:96"/>with the Body which they commanded, went to beſiege <hi>Damvilliers,</hi> while the Duke of <hi>Candalle,</hi> who was with another Body at <hi>Maubeuge,</hi> kept the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> in Breath. This Prince, after he had failed in his deſign'd relief of <hi>Capelle,</hi> endeavour'd with as little ſucceſs to oblige the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Breda,</hi> but was not able ſo much as to fall upon his Quarters. <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick-Henry</hi> enter'd this place the 9th of <hi>October,</hi> and all that the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> cou'd do, was to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of <hi>Bento</hi> and <hi>Ruremond</hi> in <hi>Guelderland.</hi> A few days after, he received the uncomfortable News, that <hi>Damvilliers,</hi> one of the beſt places in the Country of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The 23d of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </note> had ſurrendred to the Mareſchal <hi>de Chà<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> took ſeveral other ſmall places this Campaign, in the Low-Countries, and the <hi>Franche-Comté,</hi> where their Army was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Longueville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had met with no better ſucceſs in <hi>Italy</hi> than they had either in <hi>France</hi> or the Low-Countries, the Cardinalhad found juſt Reaſon for having cauſed the War to be declared againſt them. But the Loſs which <hi>France</hi> ſuſtained of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which had given them ſo much Trouble and Expence, very much diminiſhed that joy, which their great Advantages in other places gave them. As this Miniſter was wholly taken up in Intrigues at home, by which means he made a ſhift to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Poſt, he was frequently obliged to neglect Foreign Affairs, and he was the readier ſometimes to do it, becauſe the Perſons whom the King employ'd, were not in the favour of the Miniſtry. He diſcharged a great part of his Affairs upon Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was fitter to contrive any little Plots, than to manage great Affairs with Diſcretion. This gave the <hi>Griſons</hi> an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make an inſurrection in favour of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> They had never been ſatisfied with the manner of adjuſting matters between them and the Inhabitants of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> and beſides,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec. T. 8. p. p. 497.</note> no care was taken to pay their Troops, as they were promiſed. At this time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was impoſſible to do it, by reaſon of the vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in other Places, ſome of which were as good as thrown away, as particularly the great Charges they were at for equipping the Fleet, in the Year 1636,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54967:97"/>occaſion'd by the differences between the Officers, and the Mareſchal <hi>de Vitry.</hi> Thus they were indebted upwards of a Million to the Troops of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> who ſaw there was no probability of their being ſatisfied, which diſpoſed them to hearken to the Sollicitations of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> It unhappily fell out too, that the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who had a great Authority among them, fell dangerouſly ill. During his indiſpoſition, the <hi>Griſons</hi> reſolved to break with <hi>France,</hi> and they obliged one another by an Oath, to take up Arms to beat the <hi>French</hi> out of their Territories. The Three Leagues made a Treaty at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> with the Marquiſs <hi>de Leganez,</hi> and the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> for the execution of this Deſign.</p>
               <p>On the day appointed for it, the <hi>Griſons</hi> abandon'd the Poſts, which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> had given them to keep. One part of them entred into <hi>Coire,</hi> to ſecure that City againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and the reſt poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to obey any other Officers, but thoſe that were nominated by the Leagues. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> finding himſelf ſomewhat better, went to all places to appeaſe them, and by his repeated inſtances at laſt obtain'd of them to ſtay two Months, to give the King time to ſatisfie them. In the mean time, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> put themſelves in a poſture to aſſiſt the <hi>Griſons;</hi> if they ſhou'd have occaſion for them; and theſe two Months paſſed and two Months more, and yet through the Cardinal's Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, no Money came from <hi>France,</hi> though the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> repreſented to him the great Danger he was in, if ſome courſe was not taken to pay the <hi>Griſons</hi> what was due to them. It ſeems the Cardinal had a Deſign to ruine the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> by ſuffering him to loſe the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and to throw the fault at laſt wholly upon him, in caſe he did not periſh there. At laſt, all the Country took up Arms on the 18th of <hi>March,</hi> and ſome of them run to the place where the Duke was, to apprehend him; but he immediately retir'd to the Fort <hi>du Rhine,</hi> not that it was in a Condition to defend it ſelf, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the fury of the People; who were provoked to the higheſt Degree, to ſee themſelves paid with nothing but fair Words. Nay, though the Fort had been in a caſe of Defence, yet the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was not able to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54967:97"/>do any thing, becauſe it was kept by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who were fully reſolved to deliver him up. The <hi>Griſons</hi> inſiſted, That the Duke ſhould immediately give Orders for the <hi>French</hi> Troops to goe out of their Country; but, as he had no Commiſſion from the Court to doe it, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid leſt he ſhould ruine himſelf if he conſented to it. However, he was obliged ſpeedily to come to ſome reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or elſe to ſee the <hi>French,</hi> that were diſperſed in ſeveral places up and down the Country, Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>In this extremity he bethought himſelf of an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, which, at the ſame time, ſaved his own honour, and the lives of his Souldiers. And that was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, That within Twenty days, reckoning from that on which the Treaty was Signed, he would Command them to quit the <hi>Valteline.</hi> But the <hi>Griſons</hi> not being content with that propoſal, he offer'd to goe to <hi>Coire,</hi> and there to ſtay as an Hoſtage, till the entire accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhmment of the Treaty. By hazarding his Perſon thus, the Duke ſaved his Army, and gave the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King time to ſend another General to the <hi>Valteline,</hi> through the States of <hi>Venice,</hi> if he thought it convenient, or if the Court was minded to abandon this Country, they might do it then with more honour, than if the Duke had given Orders for his Troops to remove, when the <hi>Griſons</hi> would have had him doe it.</p>
               <p>In this conjuncture the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Griſons</hi> to deliver up the Duke to them, for fear he ſhould make his eſcape; but the <hi>Griſons</hi> would by no means conſent to that, but rather choſe to keep him, as a Priſoner of War, but would not give him leave to converſe with any body. The term of Twenty days was expired, and yet no Order came from Court, the Cardinal being reſolved to take no notice of the matter. However the <hi>French</hi> Troops<note n="*" place="margin">The 5th of <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note> departed, the Forts were conſigned to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and the Duke ſet at liberty. The principal Perſons of the Country ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him as far as the Frontiers, as it were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves for the Violence that had been uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. After he had croſſed <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Troops to the Province of <hi>Gex,</hi> he left them in the hands of the Count <hi>de Guebriant</hi> Mareſchal de
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54967:98"/>Camp, and retired to <hi>Geneva,</hi> there to expect His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's farther Orders. This Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was extreamly cenſured at Court, as if he had not been ſenſible that the Country would be infallibly loſt, if they did not ſpeedily ſupply him with Money, and as if he had not acquainted them with all that happen'd. The Cardinal cauſed Two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livres to be ſent to the Count <hi>de Guebriant,</hi> with Orders not to obey the Duke, but endeavour to re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Country, out of which he came, with his Troops, in caſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> were willing to aſſiſt him. But now it was too late, and the Paſſes were two well Guarded; ſo that theſe Troops, conſiſting in all of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Six thouſand Foot, and Seven hundred Horſe, were ordered, part to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the reſt for <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to joyn the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> there. From that time the War which <hi>France</hi> made in <hi>Italy,</hi> was onely a ſlight diverſion for the Forces of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and it appeared, by what followed, that the Cardinal had no other deſign than that.</p>
               <p>This year Three Princes of Europe died, whoſe death, it was to be feared, would occaſion great Diſorders. The firſt was the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the II, who died on the 14th of <hi>February.</hi> His Son, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> the III, who had been already Elected King of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſucceeded him. The Cardinal, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I don't know, would not ſuffer <hi>France</hi> to own him, either for the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or for Emperour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every thing had been done in the accuſtomed forms, and all the Catholick Princes, and the greateſt part of the Proteſtants had own'd him without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. And therefore <hi>France,</hi> which otherwiſe would have diſobliged the Electors extreamly, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, without any Neceſſity, or the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of an Advantage to be made by it, ſoon after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the III, as every one had done before them. The Affairs of the <hi>Swedes</hi> went ill enough this year in <hi>Germany;</hi> and <hi>Banier</hi> was content to put himſelf in poſſeſſion of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> after the Death of Duke <hi>Bogiſlaus</hi> the XIV, ſince he was not in a condition to moleſt the Imperialiſts.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:54967:98"/>
               <p>The ſecond Prince that died this year, was <hi>Charles Gonzaga,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> While he lived in <hi>France,</hi> as a<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>The 25th of</hi> September. <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec. T. 8. p. 478.</note> Subject, he had a great Reputation, and paſſed for a Prince of equal bravery and prudence. After he became a Soveraign, he ſeemed to bend under the weight of Affairs, and could not find any expedient to hinder the deſolation of his Countrey, either by the way of Arms, or that of Negotiation. He left his Dominions to <hi>Charles</hi> his Grandſon, born of the Duke of <hi>Rethel,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who was his Guardian. She was the Daughter of <hi>Vincent</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles Emanuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third was <hi>Butos-Amadeo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who died the 7th of <hi>October.</hi> He was as much eſteem'd as any Prince of his time, for his Conduct both in Peace and War. The onely thing he is blamed for, was his weakneſs in ſuffering <hi>Mazarine</hi> to perſwade him to deliver up <hi>Pignerol</hi> to <hi>France;</hi> by which Surrendry he left his Territories on the other ſide the Mountains to their diſcretion and Mercy. 'Tis true, he deceived <hi>Spain</hi> in doing ſo, but at the ſame time he deceived himſelf infinitely more, and onely kept the bare Title of a Soveraign Prince, unleſs he had a mind to ſhow the marks of his Soveraignty, by cauſing his Country to be ruined by the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe will he was otherwiſe obliged to follow. <hi>Francis Hyacinth,</hi> his Son, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, who dying ſoon after, <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> took his place, an Infant Four years old. The Duke his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>France</hi> his Guardian and Regent, who was owned in this quality by the Senates of <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Chambery,</hi> and by all the Orders of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Death of this<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri,</hi> Ibid. p. 481.</note> Prince was fatal to his Eſtates, becauſe he was engaged in an open War with <hi>Spain,</hi> who now had a fair opportunity to invade them, and would ſo much the ſooner embrace it, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent being Siſter to the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſhe would, in all probability, depend wholly upon him. On the other ſide, <hi>Maurice,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>Spain</hi> openly, who might have a plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to come into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to put them in poſſeſſion of the Guardianſhip and Regency, to which they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54967:99"/>whenever they thought fit. Theſe conſiderations inclined Madam of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and her Council, to endeavour to make a Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> as ſoon as might be, to hinder the ruine of her Country. Beſides, ſhe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, ſoon after the Death of the Duke her Husband, how little ſhe was to rely upon the Miniſters of the King her Brother. <hi>L'Emery,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Turin,</hi> deſign'd, with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> Troops that were quarter'd about <hi>Verceil,</hi> where the Duke died, to ſeize upon the Perſon of the Dutcheſs, and of the Princes her Sons, under a pretence to prevent the deſigns of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who would endeavour to engage this Princeſs in their Party, or at leaſt to obſerve a Neutrality. The Ambaſſador propoſed this enterprize to the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> but the Mareſchal would not conſent to be the Inſtrument of a violence of this nature, againſt a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> and againſt Princes that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King's Protection. However, the Ambaſſador, who was perfectly well acquainted with the Cardinal-Duke's Temper; and knew, that in matters of State, abundance of things are approved of when done, which would not be allowed to be done, if leave was asked before-hand, did not, for all this, deſiſt from his Deſign. But the Dutcheſs happening to be informed of it, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Marquiſs <hi>de Ville</hi> with the Troops of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to enter into <hi>Verceil</hi> by night, and cauſed the Gates to be ſhut to ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Officers that came thither, under a pretence of Buying Victuals for their Souldiers. By this means ſhe fruſtrated this Deſign, and the Troops of <hi>France</hi> had Orders to remove from <hi>Verceil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marquiſs <hi>de S. Maurice,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> having received the News of the Death of the Duke his Maſter, went to carry it to the King and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who promiſed to protect the young Duke, and the Durcheſs, with all the Forces of the Kingdom. The Cardinal gave the Ambaſſador to underſtand, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of <hi>Emery</hi>'s deſign, that the King had no hand in it, and that he would go to aſſiſt his Siſter in Perſon, if it were neceſſary. At the ſame time he adviſed the Dutcheſs to two things; one of them was, to put ſuch Subjects of the Duke, as ſhe was well aſſured of, into all the Strong Places of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy:</hi> the other
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54967:99"/>was, To treat her Brother-in-Law with all the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty imaginable, but not to ſuffer them to come into the Dominions of the Duke her Son. Upon this the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador told him, That the beſt way the Dutcheſs could take to live at peace with all the World, would be to clap up a Peace with <hi>Spain:</hi> To which the Cardinal anſwer'd, That ſhe might expect from the King her Brother every thing that was for the advantage of the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> even though it ſhould be againſt the Intereſt of the Crown, but that he did not ſee any ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in a particular Peace.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal afterwards made a Solemn Viſit to the Ambaſſador; where, after the firſt Compliments were over, he told him, <q>That he was ſurprized that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Savoy</hi> had any ſuſpicion of the <hi>French</hi> Troops, ſince the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> had immediately drawn them off from about <hi>Verceil,</hi> and conducted them to <hi>Caſal:</hi> that he had diſcover'd, upon this occaſion, the inclination of ſome of her Counſellors, that had advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to ſend with all expedition into <hi>Spain,</hi> which apparently tended to diſengage her from <hi>France;</hi> that he hoped a General Peace would be ſoon concluded, but that if the Dutcheſs and her Council were too impatient, the King would not hinder her from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a particular accommodation by her ſelf, but that his honour would not permit him to abandon his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Allies.</q>

                  <hi>Savoy</hi> was deſirous at the ſame time to come into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to offer his Services to the young Duke and the Regent by word of Mouth: but ſhe deſired him to let it alone, for fear of giving any ſuſpicion to <hi>France,</hi> with whom he very well knew ſhe was obliged to manage her ſelf cautiouſly, ſince neither her Brother, nor her Husband, could have drawn the Indignation of that Court down upon them, without being conſiderable loſers by the bargain. She likewiſe received Compliments from Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>Palavicini.</hi> This Prince repreſented to her, That the <hi>French,</hi> under a ſhow of protecting her, might take the opportunity to ſeize upon <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that if <hi>Spain</hi> was induced to bring the War thither for that reaſon, the States of the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> would
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54967:100"/>be inevitably ruin'd: that therefore ſhe ought to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from making themſelves Maſters of the Strong Places, that ſhe might not bring theſe inconveniences upon her Self; and that he was ready to come there, where his Preſence would be neceſſary, to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from poſſeſſing themſelves of all: That the more ſhe was intereſſed in the Preſervation of the Princes her Children, ſo much the greater haſt ſhe ſhould make to take the neceſſary meaſures for ſuch a Deſign; and ſo much the rather, becauſe it was viſible that this War was not carried on for the Grandeur of the King her Brother, nor of his Kingdom, but to preſerve the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in his preſent Dignity.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of this year, the Cardinal percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the King was extreamly Melancholy, did all that he could to penetrate into the reaſon of it. As the King was able to conceal nothing from him, and all thoſe that approached His Majeſty, were his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, except the Confeſſor, he came to know, that he was troubled with remorſe of Conſcience for ſuffering the Queen his Mother to be out of the Kingdom ſo long, after all the Submiſſions ſhe had made him. This Prince, who had neither good nor bad inclinations of himſelf, but as they were put into him by others, was not capable of receiving ſuch a Scruple as that, all on the ſudden; and the Cardinal ſoon diſcover'd, that the Confeſſor had poſſeſſed him with it.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Siri Mem.</hi> Rec. T. 8. p. 573.</note> This Jeſuit had the vanity to imagine, that he ſhould make himſelf ſole Maſter, and be able to deſtroy the Miniſter in a ſhort time, againſt whom he had ſpoken ſeveral things, as it were <hi>en paſſant.</hi> This was a dangerous enterpriſe, as well in reſpect of the implacable humour of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, if he did not ſucceed, as of the King's weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who told him again of every thing he heard. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Father <hi>Cauſſin,</hi> who had long deliberated upon the matter, and waited a favourable opportunity to open himſelf frankly to the King, againſt the Conduct of his Miniſter, thought he had now found it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repreſent to him all his Miſcarriages, in the moſt violent Expreſſions he could think of. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that His Majeſty ought to Diſcard him for Four principal Reaſons. The firſt was the Baniſhment
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54967:100"/>of the Queen-Mother, who was left in ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, that ſhe wanted even the Neceſſaries of Life: and this Reaſon ſeemed to make ſome impreſſion upon the King. The ſecond was, that the Cardinal uſurped all the Royal Authority, ſo that nothing remain'd to His Majeſty but the bare Name of King; and that the whole Nation had recourſe to him, as the ſupreme Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all Favours. The third was, the Oppreſſion of the People who were reduced to the laſt miſery by the exorbitant Taxes. The fourth was, the Intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which the Cardinal-Duke deſigned to annihilate, by ſupporting the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> who through his means were become more formidable than ever.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as Father <hi>Cauſſin</hi> had done talking, the King ſeemed to be moved by his Diſcourſe, which in reality contain'd nothing but notorious Truths, and ſuch as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in the Kingdom, to their coſt, were convinced of, but only himſelf. He appeared to be ſomewhat inclined to remove the Cardinal from the Miniſtry, if his Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor cou'd have named any one to him, that was capable of ſucceeding him; but that was a point he never thought of, ſo unfit he was to manage an Affair of this conſequence. The King afterwards asked him, whether he wou'd juſtifie before the Cardinal's face what he had then advanced againſt him. This Queſtion put the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit to a ſtand; however he recover'd himſelf, and told him he wou'd make the Cardinal ſubſcribe to the truth of it, ſince he had ſaid nothing but what all the World knew to be ſo. The King replied, that he ſhou'd ſee him then, and appointed a day; which was the 8th of <hi>December.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Father <hi>Cauſſin</hi> waited for this critical day, but found himſelf under ſtrange Anxieties, eſpecially when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that there was no Dependance upon the King's Reſolution, and that he muſt expect terrible Things from the Miniſter's Indignation. After he had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with himſelf a long while what he was to do in this juncture, he reſolved to communicate the whole Affair to the Duke of <hi>Angoulême,</hi> and to propoſe to him to fill the place of firſt Miniſter. The Duke going to viſit him at the Houſe of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> he made this Propoſal to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54967:101"/>him, which made him more aſtoniſhed at the Boldneſs of Father <hi>Cauſſin,</hi> than deſirous to accept the Station he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him. However, pretending to be overcome by his Reaſons, he filled him with mighty hopes, and promis'd to ſupport him as far as he was able. The Jeſuit was now impatient till the day appointed came, that he might in the Cardinal's preſence make good the Accuſations he had laid againſt him. He expected to ſee the Cardinal fall into an outrageous Paſſion, but was reſolved to puſh the Buſineſs home, whatever it coſt him.</p>
               <p>But ſcarce had the Duke of <hi>Angoulême</hi> parted from him, but chuſing the ſureſt way, he poſted directly to <hi>Ruel</hi> to acquaint the Cardinal with what he had ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learn'd. Moſt People condemn'd this Fearfulneſs in him; but the Duke excuſed himſelf upon this, that not being able to repoſe any aſſurance upon the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and ſeeing that this Affair cou'd not poſſibly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed if the Cardinal came to have the leaſt knowledge of it by any other way, he wou'd never forgive him for that Confidence which Father <hi>Cauſſin</hi> had lodged in him. The Cardinal thanked him for his Information, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him he wou'd always remember this Kindneſs: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, he went to St. <hi>Germains,</hi> to diſcourſe the King. There he recounted to him all that had paſſed, and proved the four Heads of the Accuſation to be falſe by ſuch ſort of Reaſonings as uſed to impoſe upon His Majeſty's Underſtanding. He remonſtrated to him, how dangerous it was to lend an Ear to ſuch turbulent Spirits, and concluded that the Father Confeſſor ought to be diſcarded. As for himſelf, he proteſted that he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired to go to ſome place of Retirement, and that he wou'd do it, if it wou'd not be diſadvantageous to His Majeſty's Affairs.</p>
               <p>The Confeſſor repaired to St. <hi>Germains</hi> on the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and came into the Anti-Chamber, as his uſual cuſtom was; where he was inform'd, that the King had ſhut himſelf up in his Cloſet with the Cardinal. The Conference being very long, was but a bad Omen for Father <hi>Cauſſin;</hi> and when it was over, <hi>De Noyers</hi> told him from the King, that as for that day his Majeſty wou'd not perform his Devotions, and ſo he might return to <hi>Paris.</hi> By this he underſtood that he was undone;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54967:101"/>and the very ſame Evening an Exempt of the Guards ſeized his Papers and Perſon. He was afterwards car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Quimpercorentin</hi> in <hi>Britany,</hi> where he lived in Confinement till the King's Death.</p>

He ſeem'd to be mighty zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and had been ſo far conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by <hi>Victor Amadeo,</hi> that he concerned himſelf as much in Affairs of State, as he did in thoſe that regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſcience. It came into this Man's Head, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his own proper Motion, or by the Orders of Madam of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to procure the Queen-Mother's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>France.</hi> For this end he took a Journey to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> where he contracted an Acquaintance with Father <hi>Clauſſin</hi> the Jeſuit; and as he was a Man of extraordinary Addreſs, he engaged him eaſily in this Deſign. They looked upon the Queen-Mother's Return to be as good
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54967:102"/>as impoſſible, ſo long as the Cardinal-Duke continued in favour; and therefore they concerted Matters together to ruin his Reputation with the King. To effect this, Father <hi>Cauſſin,</hi> as has been already obſerved, began to inſinuate into his Majeſty, that he cou'd not with a good Conſcience ſuffer his Mother to be any longer out of the Kingdom. The Cardinal coming to know that it was by Father <hi>Monod</hi>'s Inſtigation that Father <hi>Cauſſin</hi> had embarked in this Affair, after he had cauſed the former to be turned away, endeavoured to remove Father <hi>Monod</hi> from the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> under a pretence that he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly favoured the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Cardinal cauſed <hi>d' Emery,</hi> the Ambaſſadour, to tell Madam of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as from his Majeſty, that having ſeveral juſt Occaſions to ſuſpect Father <hi>Monod,</hi> he deſired her to diſmiſs him from Court. The Dutcheſs having no reaſon to part with her Confeſſor, whatever Stories were told againſt him, wou'd by no means give her Conſent to it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to diſabuſe the Cardinal. But the latter, who never hated any man by halves, preſs'd her to turn him away with more Obſtinacy than ever; as if it had been impoſſible for the King to live peaceably with his Siſter, and to protect her, ſo long as ſhe kept this Jeſuit about her Perſon.</p>
               <p>He was ſo incens'd againſt him, that he cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear talking of him to the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Savoy,</hi> though this Subject had no relation to the Diſcourſe then in hand.<note n="†" place="margin">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54967:102"/>
                  <hi>Monod</hi>'s living at <hi>Turin</hi> had not hinder'd the King's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters from executing his Orders. The Cardinal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, <q>That he told him nothing but the truth, and that his Majeſty cou'd communicate none of his Deſigns to Madam of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for fear leſt ſhe ſhould tell him of them again.</q> At laſt, under a pretence that Father <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> favour'd Cardinal <hi>Maurice</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Dutcheſs had evident proofs of the contrary, ſhe was forc'd to give her conſent to have him<note n="†" place="margin">About the End of the Year.</note> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. The Jeſuit being inform'd of it, endeavour'd to prevent this blow, but was taken upon the Frontiers, and put in Priſon at <hi>Montmelian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> ſent word to the Dutcheſs, that if ſhe obſerved the Neutrality, they wou'd not make the leaſt Attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Piedmont.</hi> On the other hand, <hi>France</hi> ſollicited her to renew the Treaty of a League offenſive and defenſive, made with <hi>Victor Amadco</hi> in 1635, and which was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the Month of <hi>July</hi> 1638. Moſt People were of opinion, that this Treaty was actually broke by the Death of the Duke who concluded it, as well as that of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and by the Agreement which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had lately made with <hi>Spain.</hi> The Dutcheſs was willing enough to make a defenſive League, as the Treaty of <hi>Pignerol</hi> had been, by which <hi>France</hi> was obliged to defend <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in caſe it was invaded by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Upon this ſeveral tedious Conteſts hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd; and all that the Dutcheſs ſaid ſhe cou'd conſent to, concerning the War they wou'd have her continue againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> came to this, That ſhe wou'd at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Places that had been taken in <hi>Montferrat.</hi> As for the reſt, the Council of <hi>Savoy</hi> was clearly of opinion, that ſhe ought to keep the Neutrality, to preſerve her own Country, without diſengaging her ſelf however from <hi>France,</hi> or making any new Treaty with other Princes. But it was inſiſted upon in <hi>France,</hi> that ſhe ſhould renew the Treaty of <hi>Rivoli,</hi> without having any regard to the Welfare of her State, or the Power of a Regent, which does not go ſo far as to declare a War, unleſs there be urgent neceſſity for it. Although ſhe repreſented all this by her Ambaſſadour, yet it ſignified nothing; and they daily talked of ſending a conſiderable Army into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:54967:103"/>to attack the <hi>Milaneze,</hi> and to defend <hi>Piedmont</hi> againſt the Deſigns of the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas.</hi> It was to be feared, that under a pretence of Defending it, the Cardinal wou'd make himſelf abſolute Maſter of all <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and the Dutcheſs's Council, who foreſaw this Inconvenience, did not know how to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it. Not to look back ſo far as ancient Examples, they had before their eyes that of <hi>Caſal,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> had never quitted ſince the time they firſt got footing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. Whenever they were asked to reſtore it to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> they ſtill demanded to be reimburſed for the Expences they had been at to keep it, which amounted to ſo great a Sum, that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was not in a condition to pay it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Marquiſs <hi>de Leganez</hi>

Due care had not been taken to fortifie that Poſt as it deſerved, and <hi>Montgaillard,</hi> the Governour of the place, did not acquit himſelf in that Truſt as he ought to have done; ſo that it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Town would be infallibly loſt, if it was not relieved. The Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> went thither in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and as he approached the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp, with two or three hundred Horſe, to obſerve them nearer at hand, he alighted, with his proſpective Glaſs in his hand; and leaning on a large Tree to view the Lines of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> a Cannoneer belonging to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp ſeeing ſome Horſemen on that ſide, and a Man in Red Cloaths come forward, he imagined him to be ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of Note; and pointing a ſmall Piece directly to the Tree where the Mareſchal was, gave fire; and the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let carried off the Mareſchal's Left-arm, which held the proſpective Glaſs, wounded him in the Belly, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Tree.

               <p>After the Death of the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi, France</hi> found it ſelf ſo unprovided of Generals, upon whom the Cardinal durſt rely, that they were forced to ſend the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo to order matters, that the Pope ſhould not take it ill that they had given him that Employ.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54967:104"/>Extremity in a few days. Thus having repulſed one Aſſault with Swords in their hands, Pikes, and Stones, they ſurrender'd upon compoſition, towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>July.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who was not poſted far from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, was of opinion to attack the Enemy in their Retrenchments; but the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the Dutcheſs wou'd by no means conſent to it, for fear leſt if the Enterprize ſhou'd not ſucceed, <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> wou'd be too much expoſed to the Inſults of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> After the Taking of this place, the Dutcheſs complain'd exceedingly of the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and the people ſpoke ill of the <hi>French</hi> in all places.

At the ſame time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> failed in their Deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Caſal,</hi> which was favoured by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> who was entirely of their Party, and was angry to ſee her ſelf a Dependant upon <hi>France</hi> by the means of that place. The Marquiſs <hi>de Leganez,</hi> to render the <hi>French</hi> more odious to the People, publiſh'd a Manifeſto, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declared that the true Intent of his coming into <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat</hi> was only to turn out the <hi>French</hi> from thence, and not to make War againſt the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> that were oppreſs'd by this Foreign Power. This War being on the ſide of <hi>France</hi> nothing but a politick War, to humble, as Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and as others ſaid, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf more neceſſary to the King; and the Subjects of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> not being engaged in it by Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Neceſſity, but by force, this Manifeſto of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganez</hi> produced ſtrange Effects in a ſhort time. But his Army being fatigued, was ſcarce able to attempt any thing in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> whither they came after the Taking of <hi>Verceil,</hi> and both ſides thought of withdrawing into their Winter-Quarters.</p>
               <p>The young Duke of <hi>Savoy, Francis Hyacinth,</hi> happen'd to<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 4th <hi>of</hi> October.</note> die at this time, being Seven Years old, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> ſucceeded him. This afflicted the Regent exceſſively, who now beheld all her Hopes for the future, founded upon the Life of her ſecond Son;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54967:104"/>for the Dominions belonging to the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> were to fall into the Cardinal's Hands, in caſe this young Prince ſhould die. This obliged her to unite her Self more cloſely to <hi>France</hi> than ever, and in ſpight of her own Inclinations, to reſign her Self wholly to the Cardinal's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, without whoſe good Affections, it was of no Service to her, that ſhe was the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> as well as Siſter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> parting ſecretly from <hi>Rome,</hi> came incognito to <hi>Tortone,</hi> where he made ſome attempts upon <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Carmagnole,</hi> but miſcarried in them; ſeveral Perſons that had a Hand in this Affair, were ſent to Priſon, and the Cardinal interceeded for them in a<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>In this Conjuncture, the Cardinal Duke writ frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Piedmont</hi> to the Dutcheſs, or to the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> to aſſiſt her with their Counſels.

(<hi>His meaning was, that ſhe muſt turn Father</hi> Monod <hi>away, otherwiſe the King wou'd ſupport her no longer.</hi>) That perhaps God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had permitted by an extraordinary Providence, that her Enemies ſhou'd force her to do what her natural inclination to Peace, wou'd have diſſwaded her from (<hi>to ſign the offenſive League, and to put</hi> French <hi>Troops into her Garriſons,</hi>) againſt which Reaſon and her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts ſeemed to adviſe her, that God wou'd not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways work ſuch Miracles as he had done upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to preſerve her. That in humane Affairs, he wou'd have every one make the beſt uſe of that underſtanding he had given them, and that her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for that reaſon, ought to examine her Mind, and ſee what it adviſed her to. That Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited her to it, ſince otherwiſe ſhe was unable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her Son, as well as ſecure her own Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Honour: That he wou'd not conceal from
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54967:105"/>her, that the Calumnies of her Enemies, from which ſhe might eaſily defend herſelf as long as ſhe lived, would paſs for ſo many Truths, when ſhe came to die. That to be plain with her, her Subjects did not love her, as they were obliged to do, whether becauſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Women, is never ſo well liked as that of Men, or for ſome other particular malignity; that her Highneſs very well knew what it was to pretend to a Sovereignty in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the weakneſs of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> might be perſwaded to Evil as well as to good. That in ſuffering Father <hi>Monod,</hi> to continue in his preſent Poſt, and <hi>Paſſer</hi> that ſavoured the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Savoy</hi> to be let out of Priſon, ſhe kept the worſt Councellors that ſhe cou'd have againſt her. That ſince 'twas to no purpoſe, to repreſent to her the Evil that preſs'd her, without giving her the due Remedy, he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, ſhe might ſoon put her ſelf in a condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all the World, if ſhe wou'd follow his Majeſty's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which wou'd never be different from what Nature and Reaſon inſpired: That ſhe ought therefore, without any farther difficulty, to ſecure her ſelf of Father <hi>Monod</hi>'s Perſon, and ſeverely to chaſtiſe all ſuch as had conſpired in favour of Prince <hi>Maurice:</hi> That ſuch Governours ought to be put into places, as depended abſolutely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her: That her Army was to be reinforced with Troops that ſhe cou'd rely upon; and that for the guard of her Perſon, and that of her Son, ſhe ſhould chooſe none but her own Creatures, and endeavour to encreaſe the number of them by her Kindneſſes: That if ſhe took this Conduct, he durſt with the aſſiſtance of Heaven, be anſwerable to her for the happy ſucceſs of it, towards which, he would freely contribute his own Life; but that if on the other Hand, her eaſineſs and indulgence led her the contrary way, ſhe would fall into inevitable Calamities: That he beſeech'd her to diſpenſe with him, from concerning himſelf any longer with her Affairs, becauſe if any misfortunes happen'd to her, they might not be laid to his Door, by his ſeeming to Countenance her Irreſolutions.</q> The plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all theſe Leſſons was, to make her turn away Father <hi>Monod,</hi> and to become the Oracle of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> himſelf, as he was of her Brother. Thus he ſeemed to be born

               <p>To come now to the moſt remarkable Occurrences in other places, the Cardinal ordered the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was at <hi>Geneva,</hi> to retire to <hi>Venice,</hi> leaſt out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for his baſe uſage, he might carry on ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt him. But the Duke pretending it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> the ways being all ſtopp'd, he went to confer with the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and afterwards came to him at his Army. They had frequent Conferences together, which made the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal very uneaſie, and it was reported, that the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> was to marry the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Rohan.</hi> The former, after he had taken ſome few pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, went to beſiege <hi>Rhinfeld,</hi> the Capital of the four Forreſt Cities. <hi>Jean de Werth,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savelli,</hi> and the other Generals of the Emperour, marched to the relief of it with Ten Thouſand Men. The Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> being informed of their March, went to meet them by the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Advice, and the latter who refuſed to have any ſhare in the command of the Army, putting himſelf at the head of the Left Wing,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 28th <hi>of</hi> Febr.</note> was one of the firſt that began the onſet and fought like a common Soldier. The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were beaten, after the diſpute had laſted a long while, but the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was wounded by two Muſquet-ſhots, of which he died on the 23d of <hi>April:</hi> although the King ſent him an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Letter, to thank him for the great Services he had done the Crown, yet he was not ſorry for his Death, for his great qualities, and the paſt Wars had long drawn upon him the diſpleaſure of the Court, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heartily reconciled to him, but only in outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The Cardinal who by his good Will, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd none in his Majeſty's Service, but ſuch as were ready to do every thing he commanded them, and who had uſed him ill more than once, looked upon himſelf to be now delivered from a dangerous Enemy.</p>

He
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54967:106"/>performed it at laſt, but beat the Imperialiſts twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cou'd lock up this place at a convenient diſtance. After this, the Enemy endeavour'd to throw Succours into the Town, and were repulſed with Loſs. At laſt, <hi>Weimar</hi> forced <hi>Briſac</hi> to ſurrender, for want of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on the 19th of <hi>December.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Place wou'd have been of mighty importance to <hi>France,</hi> but the great Services which the Duke of <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> had done, thoſe he might ſtill do, and the promiſe which his Majeſty had given him to make him <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> were the Reaſons why they ſuffered him to enjoy this Conqueſt. In ſhort, he put himſelf in poſſeſſion of it, and the Court connived at it, that they might not diſoblige him at a time when he might do them as much Miſchief as Good, till they found an occaſion to get it into their own Hands, as we ſhall find in the Series of the Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>This was the greateſt Advantage which <hi>France</hi> obtain'd this Year againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The<note n="*" place="margin">

However the Cardinal took it into hand again, and offered to truſt the management of it with the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> and <hi>la Valette,</hi> upon Condition that they wou'd advance one part of the expences of the War, and find a way to make the Province of <hi>Guienne</hi> bear it.

Being afraid the Cardinal put them upon this enterpriſe, to carry on their Deſtruction, they rather choſe that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſhou'd take it.

               </p>
               <p>While he inveſted this place, <hi>d' Eſpernon</hi> took <hi>Paſſage,</hi> where he found Six <hi>Galleons,</hi> and Five <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Men of War, furniſhed with all manner of Proviſions, which he ſeized upon. Five more of their <hi>Galleons</hi> fell into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and the Admiral of this Fleet was ſunk. Nothing cou'd begin more happily than
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54967:107"/>this Affair, and there was very good reaſon to expect it wou'd ſucceed, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never imagined that the <hi>French</hi> wou'd attack them on the ſide of <hi>Guipuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa. Don Chriſtoforo Meſſia,</hi> who had lately been made Governour of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> was not as yet come to his Government. The Garriſon which generally conſiſted of Five Hundred Men, cou'd ſcarce make Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the inhabitants joyning with them, cou'd not amount to above Seven Hundred fit to bear Arms. But they had a famous Engineer in the Town, named <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Perez,</hi> a Native of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and D. <hi>Dominique E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quia Deſtur,</hi> another <hi>Biſcainer,</hi> a Man of Courage, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to the Commandant. The Prince open'd the Trenches on the 10th of <hi>July;</hi> and on the 2d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, conſiſting of Forty Two Veſſels, full Mann'd with Soldiers that were to be ſet on Shore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Port of <hi>Fontarabia.</hi> They took immediately or put to Flight ſeveral <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pinnaces that came there, and gave chaſe to a Fleet of Fifty Sail, that brought Succours and Refreſhments to the Beſieged. The Arch-biſhop receiving Information, that in the Road of <hi>Gatari,</hi> there lay Forty Men of War, and ſeveral other ſmaller Veſſels, bore up to them, and ſome he Burnt, and others he forced to run aſhore, although they were defended with ſome Batteries, that were raiſed on purpoſe by the Sea-ſide. Abundance of <hi>Spaniards</hi> were loſt in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that were burnt in the Ships or Drowned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, the two old Regiments of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that made up about Three Thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> on the other hand, loſt in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not above Two hundred Men, with ſome Officers, and onely Nine or Ten of their Veſſels ſuſtained any damage.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Fontarabia</hi> loſt all hopes of being relieved by Sea; and as for what Succours could come to it by Land, the Prince flatter'd himſelf that he might take it, before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could be in a condition to take the Field. The Arch-biſhop, at his return from his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, offer'd to Guard the Port of <hi>Paſſage,</hi> and the Mouth of the River <hi>Orio,</hi> by which way the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might throw Succours into the Town. This Affair was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54967:108"/>in a Council of War, but as it could not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without dividing the Army, and they hoped to carry the place in a ſhort time, the Prince was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was the beſt way to abandon <hi>Paſſage,</hi> not conſidering what advantage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might make of this Poſt, if the Siege held much longer. In the mean time, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, Commanded by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> came in ſight, and their Proviſions arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved principally to them by the means of the Port of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,</hi> which made them, now it was too late, ſee, the great over-ſight they had committed. But the chief fault was, that the Prince, who was not much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in Sieges, had not preſt the Works with that vigour as was requiſite. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Tops of the Neighbouring Mountains, were within Muſquet-ſhot of the Advanced-Guards of the <hi>French,</hi> ſo that daily Skirmiſhes happened between the two Armies.</p>
               <p>Altho' the Garriſon was inconſiderable, as to its num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Commandant made ſeveral Sallies, to retard the Works of the <hi>French,</hi> and to give time for relief to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to them. Ar firſt he had good ſucceſs in them, but making one more conſiderable than the reſt, at which time the <hi>French</hi> happen'd to be better upon their Guard than they uſed to be, they loſt a Hundred Men, among whom was <hi>Michael Perez,</hi> who died of his Wounds in the place.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Garriſon was ſo much diminiſhed, that it held out onely in hopes, that the Cardinal of <hi>Caſtile</hi> would come ſpeedily to relieve it; and, they ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, That if he did not make haſt, they ſhould be obliged to Surrender, as not being in a condition to ſuſtain an Aſſault.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Attacks were ſtill carried on, and ſeveral Mines were played, one of which, on the ſide of the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi>'s Attack, proved fatal to the Beſiegers<note n="*" place="margin">In the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having at laſt got his Men to Mount the Breach, he found that the Enemy had made a Retrenchment there, and a Palliſado; and as thoſe that were there demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Re-inforcement, and Inſtruments to make a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that place, he ſent them Orders to come back, not thinking them able to maintain this Poſt, or as others believe, out of Jealouſie to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to make him miſcarry before this place.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Prince being provoked, gave the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi>'s Attack to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who offer'd to finiſh the Lodgment, and make himſelf Maſter of the Place in three days, if the Duke would quit his quarter.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54967:109"/>them the ſame way. The Quarter belonging to the Marquiſs <hi>de la Force,</hi> which they attack'd the firſt, was immediately carried; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that firſt entred it turning the Canon againſt the <hi>French,</hi> who fled in ſo great a diſorder, that the Marquiſs was not able, by all the Arguments he could uſe, to make them rally. In the mean time the Officers, who ſtill kept their ground, ſent for the Prince's Order, to know whether they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, or Charge the Enemy; but he beholding the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, deſpaired of being able to retrieve it; ſo he Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a good time in a Veſſel, which carried him to <hi>St. John de Luz.</hi> They ſent to find the Duke <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi> in his Quarter, but, before this happen'd, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd his Poſt to the Arch-biſhop, by the Prince's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and was a League from thence. As for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he Shipt his Men, and likewiſe retired. In the mean time the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> being informed by ſome Fugitives, That the Enemy had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Lines, and that all was in diſorder; ran to his Quarter to endeavour to rally as many of his Men as he was able, or at leaſt to give them Orders to make their Retreat in the moſt advantageous manner they could. But the General having diſappear'd, as well as the Naval Forces, the reſt retired in confuſion, leaving all their Baggage, Artillery, and Ammunition behind them. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> chiefly employ'd in Pillaging the Camp, did not purſue them; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> loſt but very few Men in the retreat. Thus the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who, in theſe matters, could neither give nor follow good Advice, was defeated by an Army, which was, in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, inferiour to his own. To excuſe himſelf, he laid the fault upon the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> as if he had been the occaſion why this Place was not taken in the ſpace of Two months, which before another General could not have held out Fifteen days, conſidering the condition it was in. The Cardinal, who durſt not fall out with the Prince, but was incens'd, to the utmoſt degree, to ſee a deſign, of his own projecting, miſ-carry, like thoſe of the Count-Duke againſt <hi>France,</hi> reſolved to ruine the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> notwithſtanding the great Friendſhip that was between him and the Cardinal his Brother, who durſt not undertake to deſend him, unleſs he was found
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54967:109"/>innocent. As for the Accuſation of Cowardice, which ſome laid to his charge, he boldly maintain'd, that it was falſe; but he durſt not wholly excuſe him from jealouſie. In the mean time the D. <hi>de la Valette</hi> retired into <hi>England,</hi> altho' he was ſent for to Court. The Cardinal his Brother had a meanneſs of Soul ſo directly oppoſite to the Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs bravery of the D. of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> their Father, that this Gallant Old Man was us'd to call him, not the <hi>Cardinal de la Valette;</hi> but, <hi>the Valet of a Cardinal.</hi> But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal-Duke would entertain none for his Friends, but ſuch as were blindly devoted to all his Paſſions.</p>

This correſpondence was onely concerning a Peace, which the Queen had reaſon to conſider as a Work extrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, and very advantageous to the People, who were drained and oppreſſed on all ſides. Great Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were wholly depopulated, without any conſiderable advantages obtained, either on this, or t'other part, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfie the ambitious pretenſions of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> or of the Cardinal, againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The manner of their keeping this private Commerce, was as follows. The Cardinal Infanta's Letters were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a certain Nun of <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> who hid them in the Cloſet of an Oratory which the Queen had in that Convent, and whither ſhe frequently went. The Queen likewiſe left her own in the ſame place, and this Nun
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54967:110"/>took care to fetch, and give them to one <hi>la Porte,</hi> who ſent them to <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The Cardinal, who had more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſpy, even the leaſt Actions of the King and Queen, than thoſe were to watch his own, came to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; and, as he looked upon a Peace, as a thing that would prove fatal to his Grandeur, he reſolved to break off this Correſpondence, whatever it coſt him. He had effectually poſſeſſed the King with deep prejudices againſt the Queen, ever ſince ſhe engaged her Self in Cabals oppoſite to his Authority, as I have elſewhere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. So it was no difficult matter for him to make His Majeſty believe, how dangerous it was to ſuffer the Queen to Write to a Declared Enemy of the State. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore order'd <hi>la Porte</hi> to be apprehended, he was minded to Interrogate him himſelf, to effect which, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd to <hi>Chavigny</hi>'s Apartment, and threw himſelf upon his Bed; after he had order'd the Curtains to be drawn, that ſo he might diſcourſe him without being ſeen. Then <hi>la Porte</hi> was order'd to come into the Room, and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal began to queſtion him in a Counterfeit-Voice. But this new manner of examining a Priſoner did not ſucceed as he imagin'd, for <hi>la Porte</hi> knew his Voice immediately, and ſtood upon his Guard. Upon this he order'd the Chancellor to go to <hi>Val de Grace</hi> to the Queen's Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and there to ſeize the Letters of Her Majeſty, and the Cardinal-Infanta. The Chancellor, however he was intirely devoted to him, yet, apprehenſive of what might hereafter happen to him from the Queen's part, was for finding out a way to obey the Cardinal, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Queen too much, and therefore gave her private Intimation of the Command he had received. This Princeſs having no body about her to Conſult in this ſtrange Conjuncture, ſent the Marchioneſs <hi>de Sennecey</hi> to the Marquiſs <hi>de Puyſieux,</hi> who, ever ſince his Diſgrace, had lived at his Country-Houſe, to demand his Advice upon this occaſion. He was ſomewhat troubled that the Queen ſhould Conſult him upon ſo nice an affair as this was, knowing the implacable humour of this Miniſter; but, at laſt, he could not refuſe to tell Her his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Matter.</p>
               <p>One day, when the Queen was at <hi>Val de Grace,</hi> the Chancellor came there, and acquainted Her with the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54967:110"/>Commiſſion which the King had given him. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards asked Her ſome Queſtions, but ſo, as to Inſinuate to Her Majeſty, what Anſwers ſhe was to make him. And the Queen pointed with her Finger to the place where ſhe uſed to keep the Cardinal-Infanta's Letters, and gave him the Keys of it. She told him, That as for what related to the Prince her Brother, ſhe could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtifle the affection which Nature obliged her to ſhow him, but that ſhe knew how to love her Brother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing the State; a Maxim directly contrary to that of the Cardinal-Duke, who had poſſeſſed the King, That it was impoſſible for him to love His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and his Mother, with his other neareſt Relations, at the ſame time. The Queen had taken the Precaution to truſt all her Papers with the Marchioneſs <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> Daughter to the Count <hi>de Carmail;</hi> So that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor found nothing in the Cloſet but a few Diſciplines.</p>
               <p>From hence he return'd to carry this News to the Cardinal, who was enraged to miſs his Blow, after he had put an Affront of this nature upon the Queen. It fell out very luckily for this Princeſs that ſhe was big with Child, otherwiſe he had too cruelly offended her, not to uſe all his Efforts to ruin her; and he had formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the King more than once, to be divorced from her. At the ſame time another Accident happen'd at Court, which was not indeed of the ſame conſequence, but ſerves as well to diſcover the prodigious Authority of the Miniſter. The King had fallen in love with Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de la Fayette,</hi> and had for ſome time entertain'd a Commerce with her, which was by no means pleaſing to the Cardinal, who cou'd not endure to ſee any one in favour with the King that did not wholly depend upon him. It happen'd without the King's knowing the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, that this Lady retired to a Convent call'd <hi>La Viſitation,</hi> to put her ſelf in the Service, as ſhe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of a greater Lord than he was. The King was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly inquiſitive to know the reaſon of ſo ſudden a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement; and not contenting himſelf with what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Creatures had been inſtructed to tell him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſcover the whole Myſtery himſelf: ſo pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hunt in the Foreſts which lye between <hi>Gresbois</hi> and this Monaſtery, he came to this laſt place, where he had
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54967:111"/>a long Converſation with Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Fayette:</hi> and thus they came to be ſatisfied that they had been both cheated by <hi>Boizenval,</hi> Valet de Chambre to his Majeſty, who nevertheleſs ow'd his preferment to this Lady. Whenever the King ſent him to Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette,</hi> to deliver any Meſſage to her, or carry her a Billet, and whenever this Lady ſent him back to the King, or writ to him, he went directly to the Cardinal, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Billets to be chang'd, as he ſaw convenient, by counterfeiting the Hand, or elſe order'd him what Anſwers to make. This imperious Miniſter had engaged him thus to ſacrifice the King and his Benefactreſs, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him word, that ſince he was made Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre without a Recommendation from him, he muſt not expect to enjoy that Poſt long. <hi>Boizenval</hi> affrighted at this Menace, which he did not queſtion but the Cardinal wou'd ſoon put in execution, went to acquaint him, that if he wou'd be pleaſed to take him into his Protection, he wou'd blindly obey him in whatever he ſhou'd think fit to order. The Cardinal promis'd it, upon condition he wou'd inform him of every thing he ſaw: And thus <hi>Boizenval</hi> communicated to him the King's Billets, and thoſe of his Miſtreſs, which he alter'd in ſuch a manner as was moſt proper to inſpire them with a diſguſt each for the other. At the ſame time the Cardinal threaten'd the Marchioneſs <hi>de Sennecey,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Limoges,</hi> who were related to Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Fayette,</hi> to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them the Court, unleſs they prevailed with this Lady to betake her ſelf to a Retirement. Their Advice, and the Letters ſhe received from the King, obliged her at laſt to think of a Recluſe Life; and ſhe accordingly put this Deſign in execution, as it has been already ſaid. The King being inform'd that ſhe had received ſome Billets which were wholly different from thoſe which he had writ to her, was ſenſible that <hi>Boizenval</hi> had betray'd him, and reſolv'd to turn him out of his place. While he was in the Parler with Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Fayette, Boizenval,</hi> who had follow'd him, was at the Gate, and came to underſtand, as ſoon as ever the King was gone, that His Majeſty and She had been talking of the Cheat he had put upon them. By this be concluded himſelf to be undone, and next morning he was diſcarded; yet
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54967:111"/>the Cardinal did not condeſcend to ſpeak one word in favour of him to the King, leſt he ſhould thereby diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from what Quarter the Cheat proceeded.</p>
               <p>The King had ſpent four hours in entertaining himſelf with Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Fayette;</hi> ſo that it being too late for him to go back and lie at <hi>Gresbois,</hi> he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Queen<note n="*" place="margin">The 5th of <hi>September.</hi>

In all probability too, it ſeem'd to threaten the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Authority, who had for a conſiderable time drawn the Queen's Hatred upon himſelf; but he was ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of the entire Management of the King's Will, that this did not cauſe the leaſt Alteration in his Power.

Belliévre</hi> was at that time Ambaſſadour in <hi>England,</hi> and the Queen-Mother having found an opportunity to converſe with him, although he ſtudiouſly endeavour'd to avoid it, ſhe acquainted him, that ſhe had for ſome time employed all the means ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to ſignifie to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> the extraordinary deſire ſhe had to return into <hi>France</hi> through his means; but that ſhe had received no manner of Anſwer from him, and that no Promiſes had been ever made her, but upon ſuch hard Conditions that ſhe could not comply with them. The Ambaſſadour interrupted her, and deſired her Majeſty to remember, that the King had ſent him in the Character of Ambaſſadour to the King of <hi>England,</hi> but that he had not the Honour to be ſent to her. He added, that if her Diſcourſe tended to command him to write about her to <hi>France,</hi> he deſired her not to charge him with that Commiſſion, becauſe he had no Order to meddle with any thing, whatever it was, that concerned
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54967:112"/>her Majeſty. The Queen replied, that then they had not forbidden him to do it; and the Ambaſſadour made Anſwer, That he had no Orders. To this the Queen rejoyn'd, That it ſignified nothing at all; and, that ſhe requeſted him to liſten to her; That the Afflictions ſhe had ſuſtained ſince her Departure out of <hi>France</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired her with quite different Sentiments from what ſhe had when ſhe quitted that Kingdom; That ſhe ſhould think her ſelf infinitely obliged if he would acquaint the Cardinal, that ſhe conjur'd him to deliver her out of this Miſery, and the neceſſity of begging her Bread; That ſhe long'd exceedingly to be near the King, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her ſelf in the leaſt with any Affairs, but to paſs the Remainder of her Life in Repoſe and Tranquillity, and employ it in ſerving of God, and thinking how to die well; That if the Cardinal cou'd not obtain leave of the King for her to return to Court, he wou'd at leaſt get permiſſion for her to live in ſome part of <hi>France,</hi> where His Majeſty thought convenient, and there to provide for her Maintenance; That ſhe wou'd turn away all ſuch out of her Service that were either hated or ſuſpected by him; and, That ſhe was ready to do all that the King order'd and the Cardinal counſell'd her to do; That this was all ſhe deſir'd him to communicate to the Cardinal, becauſe ſhe believed that ſome Perſons who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to do it, had not acquitted themſelves faithfully in this Affair. The Ambaſſadour anſwer'd, that he wou'd never give her the ſame occaſion to complain of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not concern himſelf in her Buſineſs. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the Queen told him, that this was the Stile of all Ambaſſadours, who nevertheleſs were obliged to write all that was ſaid to them; and that ſhe wou'd not fail to expect his Anſwer. The Queen of <hi>England</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards gave <hi>Belliévre</hi> to underſtand, that they had pitch'd upon this way, becauſe the King had declared that he wou'd not have any Strangers interpoſe to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate Matters between him and his Mother.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54967:113"/>ſo much the more as ſhe appeared to humble her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the Miniſter, and who if ſhe were in <hi>France,</hi> wou'd not fail to diſcover to the King all that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from him; and laſtly, the implacable Malice of the Cardinal himſelf, who ſeldom quitted what had once fully poſſeſs'd him, determin'd him to reject all Offers which this afflicted Princeſs cauſed to be made to him; and as for the King, he had not of a long while thought fit to deliberate upon any thing which he ſaw was not approved by this Miniſter. Thus the Cardinal having dictated a Letter, in the King's Name, to <hi>Cheré</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, his Majeſty ſigned it. He pretended that before he had read an Extract of <hi>Belliévre</hi>'s Diſpatches, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Propoſitions which the Queen-Mother had made to him, he had told the Council of his own proper motion, that he believed there was no longer room to rely upon the fair Words of the Queen his Mother, who had always been accuſtomed to diſſemble; that her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Temper hinder'd her from being able to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in any place, ſince ſhe cou'd never bear her Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when ſhe was in <hi>France,</hi> nor agree in <hi>Flanders</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> after ſhe had obliged him to leave the Kingdom to go thither, no more than with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to whom ſhe had married him; that it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Deſign that ſhe went to <hi>Holland,</hi> and that ſhe was already diſguſted with <hi>England;</hi> that if ſhe was not able to content her ſelf with the extraordinary Authority which ſhe enjoyed before her Departure out of <hi>France,</hi> much leſs wou'd ſhe reſt ſatisfied with what they cou'd give her at preſent, and which wou'd be nothing near ſo great as what ſhe formerly had; that conſidering her aſpiring Humour, ſhe wou'd be no ſooner in <hi>France,</hi> but ſhe wou'd oblige the Malecontents to occaſion new Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that the more eaſily, becauſe the greateſt part of them had been formerly engaged in her Intereſts; that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had deſpiſed her in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wou'd not fail to influence her to excite Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>France</hi> as ſoon as ſhe was arrived there, and that merely for this Conſideration they deſired her Return; that within 7 or 8 Months ſhe had endeavour'd to form a new Party at <hi>Sedan,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54967:113"/>Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> though ſhe cou'd draw nothing but bare Words from them; that the King of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in vain interceded for her, deſign'd to ſend her elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; that all theſe Reaſons obliged him to ſtick firm to the Propoſal he had made to the Queen his Mother that ſhe ſhou'd retire to <hi>Florence,</hi> where ſhe ſhould receive what was ſufficient to maintain her according to her Quality; that laſtly, his Conſcience was ſatisfied, and that he ſhou'd be juſtified before God and before Men, ſince he had done all that in him lay, to ſatisfie the Queen, without expoſing his Kingdom to new Broils and Troubles.</p>
               <p>Upon this Anſwer, which was wholly founded upon this Suppoſition, That the Queen-Mother wou'd embroil the Kingdom, in caſe ſhe came back, as if they had been certainly aſſur'd of it, and that there was no way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, but by ſending her home to <hi>Florence;</hi> the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> touched for her Mothers Affliction, writ ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters to the King and Cardinal with her own Hand, and ſent them by my Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi> to confirm them by Word of Mouth. The King anſwered theſe Letters by others, which <hi>Chavigny</hi> compoſed and were corrected by the Cardinal, wherein he commends the good intentions of his Siſter, but deſired her not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe in this Affair; that he intended on his Side to give his Mother all reaſonable Satisfaction, but that ſhe had ingag'd her Self in ſo many Cabals againſt him, that he cou'd come to no other Reſolution about her, till a Peace was concluded; that as for the Maintenance they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for her, he was afraid ſhe was abuſed by her own Evil Councellors, as if there was no Medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween granting her all, and refuſing his Mother a Dowry, which lawfully belonged to her, and yet <hi>Lewis the Juſt</hi> refus'd it her.</p>
               <p>Thus my Lord <hi>Jermyn</hi>'s Negotiation came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and though he offer'd in the Name of the King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to ingage for the good Conduct of the Queen-Mother, and promiſed every thing which cou'd in reaſon be expected, yet they would talk of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than ſending this unfortunate Princeſs to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> where they promiſed to ſettle an Appointment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54967:114"/>her, which perhaps they wou'd have ſtopt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. No one durſt ſpeak a word to the King upon this occaſion, and the good Prince could not bethink himſelf of any middle Expedient, between treating his Mother with this exceſſive Rigour, only to pleaſe the Cardinal, and reſtoring her to her firſt Authority. He cou'd without jealouſie, behold his chief Miniſter aſſume a Power infinitely greater than the Queen-Mother had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to, and abuſe it in a more notorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yet it never diſturbed him; but the Cardinal had gain'd that abſolute Aſcendant over him, and had ſo far poſſeſſed him, that without him, both he and his Kingdom wou'd be intirely ruin'd, and that none but he had honeſt intentions towards him, that he perceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Cardinal's Deſigns.</p>
               <p>However to ſecure himſelf in ſome meaſure from the Inhumanity which the World wou'd be apt to charge him with, in refuſing to let the Queen-Mother return, ſince ſhe deſir'd it with ſo much Submiſſion, he wou'd not declare his own Opinion in the Council upon this Affair: But he ingag'd the other Miniſters to give their Sentiments in Writing, which he drew up for them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and they afterwards ſign'd.

According to theſe Slaves of the Cardinal, <hi>France</hi> wou'd be undone, if the King made any Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Mother, and this Action of the King reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Separation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> from the <hi>Virgin-Mary.</hi> They gave this Advice to his Majeſty, in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> and their Names that ſign'd are as follow, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier.

                  <hi>Rapporteurs de la Poſterie,</hi> and <hi>Machaut</hi> concluded after a long reaſoning, that his Body was to be apprehended, and then the King ſpoke to the reſt to give their Opinion. <hi>Pinon</hi> began his Harangue with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that in all the Fifty Years he had been a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of Parliament, he never remembred a thing of ſo vaſt an importance to have come before them; that he conſider'd the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> as a Perſon that had the Honour to be married to the King's Natural Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and as a Duke and a Peer, and that therefore his Judgment was, That this Cauſe ought to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament. The King told him that this was not giving his Opinion, and that he did not take it as
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54967:115"/>ſuch. But <hi>Pinon</hi> anſwer'd, That in the Order of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, a Reference was a lawful Vote. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in great Anger, That he wou'd have them give their opinion of the Merits of the Cauſe; and <hi>Pinon</hi> made anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, That ſince his Majeſty commanded him, he was of the ſame Opinion with the former. The Preſidents <hi>Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and <hi>Leguier</hi> ſaid the ſame thing, ſeeing the King poſitively bent to have it ſo. The Preſident <hi>de Bailleal,</hi> who had heard at his coming into the Hall, that the Cardinal ſhou'd ſay, That the King wou'd make the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> taſte of his Mercy once more, ſaid that he approved of the Overture which the Cardinal had made; but the latter reply'd, That he needed only to cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Robe to give his Opinion: ſo he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd by the King's Command, to do as thoſe before him had done. The Preſident <hi>de Meme;</hi> thought of his Bonnet without ſaying a Word. The Preſident <hi>de Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> after a long Diſcourſe, wherein he remark'd that no mention was made, neither of the Name, nor Age of the Witneſſes that ſwore againſt the Duke, and that the proceſs was againſt the uſual Forms, as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſs'd, declar'd, that he thought the Duke ought perſonally to appear: and beſides that, he cou'd not in Conſcience give his Opinion in the place where he was. He added, that if the King conſtrain'd him, he wou'd be of the moſt favourable Side, becauſe he wou'd not load his Conſcience. The Preſident <hi>de Belliévre</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up, ſaid, That in his Judgment, this cauſe ought to be ſent back to the Parliament, but as the King obliged him to paſs his Judgment upon the equity of the matter, he made a ſhort but handſom Diſcourſe, the ſubſtance of which was, That he thought it was extremely ſtrange, that his Majeſty ſhou'd interpoſe in the Trial of one of his Subjects; that his Anceſtors were accuſtomed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Graces to themſelves, and to remit Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to the Tribunals of Juſtice; that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that his Majeſty had rigour enough in him to ſee a Man upon a Sledge to be dragg'd the next Hour after to a Gibbet; that the ſight of a King carried Acts of Clemency along with it; that it took off Eccleſiaſtical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicts, and that no one ought to depart from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54967:115"/>diſſatisfied. He afterwards took notice how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient it was for them to deliver their Opinions before the King, ſince they were not at liberty to ſpeak their Thoughts freely. The King, after he had heard him with a great deal of Patience, commanded him to ſpeak poſitively to the matter in Hand. <hi>Belliévre</hi> made anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, That theſe were his Sentiments: but the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour ſtill preſſing him to give his Opinion; he ſaid, That it was time loſt to ſpeak, if he muſt ſay nothing but what the Chancellor approv'd of, and ſo ſtuck ſtill to his firſt Judgment. The <hi>Premier</hi> Preſident continued to inſiſt upon a Reference, but at laſt gave his Opinion, that the Duke's Body was to be ſeized.</p>
               <p>After the Preſidents had done, the Councellors declared their Sentiments; and it was remarkable enough, that <hi>le Bret</hi> alledged the Cuſtom of the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Leon Bralart</hi> the moſt violent Proceedings of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> to ſerve as a Rule upon this Occaſion. After this, the Dukes and Peers ſpoke, and were follow'd by the Chancellour, by the Cardinal, and by the King. At laſt the Court roſe, and the King calling the Preſidents to him, told them in a great Paſſion, that they always made it their Buſineſs to diſobey his Orders, that he was extreamly ill ſatisfied with their Conduct, and that he hated all thoſe that were againſt his Trying a Duke and Peer out of Parliament; that they were ſorry, ignorant Wretches, unworthy of Places, and that for all he knew, he might put others in their room; that he was reſolv'd to be obey'd, and that he wou'd make them ſee, that all their Privileges were only founded upon an illegal Uſage; and laſtly, that he wou'd hear them argue no more about the Matter. Thus the blindeſt of all Kings, with whom the Arbitrary Courſes of his Miniſter paſs'd for Law and Policy, violated all the Ordinances, as if there had been no ſuch thing as Juſtice in <hi>France</hi> before the Cardinal-Duke ſate at the Helm, and that all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtoms ow'd their Original to Madmen and Fools. It was too dangerous a point to endeavour to make him ſenſible of his Error, not only by reaſon of the vaſt Authority of the Miniſter, but his own natural <hi>Opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trete,</hi> which was as great, as his Knowledge and Inſight
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54967:116"/>into Things was ſmall. Thus he cou'd never have been brought to comprehend what might have been ſaid to him concerning the beginning of Laws, and the great Advantage which Princes as well as their Subjects find in ſeeing them carefully obſerv'd.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54967:116"/>to ruin his Deſigns: That none of theſe Witneſſes had depoſed, that he ſent any Letters to the Enemy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any from them, or kept any Correſpondence with them, or their Adherents: That conſequently he judged him innocent in reſpect of this Allegation: That as for his Diſobedience to his General, this was a point purely military, the Cognizance whereof belonged to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that Profeſſion; and that if the Duke were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he might perhaps demonſtrate the contrary: That as to this Article, the Witneſſes depoſed no more than that the Breach was reaſonable; and that if an Aſſault had been made immediately, in all appearance the Place had been taken: That it was a Matter of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to ſubmit the Honour and Life of a General to the Judgment of thirty Soldiers: That nevertheleſs tho' there was not any direct proof of theſe two Capital Points, of which the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> was accuſed, to condemn him to die; yet he thought him to be ſo great a Criminal for leaving the Kingdom, and not appearing to juſtifie himſelf, even though he were in perſon, that he was of opinion that he deſerved to be baniſhed for nine Years, to be turn'd out of his Places, and to pay a Fine of a hundred thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Chancellour replied, That from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Principle it was that the Duke <hi>de la Valette</hi> had made the King loſe the Opportunity of Taking <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarabia,</hi> and diſobey'd his General, this Action was of ſuch mighty prejudice to the State, that he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the Attorney-General's Sentence was juſt.

                  <hi>D' Emery</hi> was likewiſe order'd to return from <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to fortifie <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and make the ſame propoſitions to the Dutcheſs. Beſides this, in caſe the Dutcheſs made a Treaty of Neutrality, or a Ceſſation of Arms with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to confer with the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> to ſee how one might ſeize thoſe places which lay upon the road from <hi>Pignerol</hi> to <hi>Caſal;</hi> and to effect this deſign in caſe it were feaſible.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal in the mean time, in all his Letters to the Dutcheſs, and to the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> gave them to underſtand, that this Princeſs cou'd never truly reckon herſelf miſtreſs of any place, where ſhe had <hi>Piedmonteſe</hi> Governours, even tho the Garriſon was <hi>French,</hi> becauſe thoſe Governors wou'd make the people riſe up againſt the Garriſons. In this conjuncture the Dutcheſs ſent to acquaint Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> that if he did not ſurrender the places he had taken, ſhe was reſolved to throw up all which ſhe had into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who already poſſeſſed <hi>Carmagnole</hi> and <hi>Queraſque,</hi> and who wou'd ſoon be maſters of <hi>Turin,</hi> if they had once the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. Soon after ſhe began a Treaty with her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers-in-law, by which ſhe agreed to divide the Guardianſhip with them, and to receive them into <hi>Turin;</hi> which had it gone on, would have infallibly ſubjected her to their power, and made her entirely depend upon them. The Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> took a great deal of pains to make her comprehend, that ſhe wou'd abſolutely ruin herſelf, if ſhe concluded this Treaty; But when they came to talk to her of putting the reſt of her Towns into the hands of the King, who was only to keep them for her, till ſuch time as ſhe cou'd maintain them ſafely herſelf; then ſhe cry'd out, that inſtead of aſſiſting her, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to plunder her of all ſhe had, and wou'd not hear them mention the leaſt ſyllable of it for ſeveral days. She was afraid that if theſe places were once out of her power and ſurrendred to them, they wou'd afterwards pay her juſt ſo much reſpect as they ſhou'd ſee convenient, and thus ſhe might come to loſe all her authority. But the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> having
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54967:120"/>found means to gain her Councellors over to their party, by penſions which they promis'd them in the Kings name; and in particular, the Cardinal having corrupted the Abbot <hi>de la Monta,</hi> by reſigning the Abby of <hi>Nantes</hi> to him; the Dutcheſs began to ſoften a little, and as ſhe wanted ready money for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſupport, there was a neceſſity for her at laſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of her ſelf to come to the Cardinal's Lure.

The Cardinal principally deſired, that the Dutcheſs would put the Caſtle of <hi>Montme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melian</hi> into the King's hands, where Father <hi>Monod</hi> was; for which end it was propos'd to this Jeſuit to leave it if he pleas'd, but he could not be prevail'd with to agree to it, fearing that he ſhould be ſtill in greater danger if he departed out of it, than if he continued there.</p>

He endeavour'd to perſwade her to truſt the King, at leaſt in appearance, with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to put the Duke her Son into his hands. The Dutcheſs could not bring herſelf to give her conſent to it, for fear leſt this apparent truſt, as the Cardinal call'd it, ſhould become but too real, if the King gained the Governor of <hi>Montmelian,</hi> or made himſelf Maſter of it any other way. It came to be diſcover'd that Count <hi>Philip d' Aglie</hi> adviſed the Dutcheſs to continue firm to this reſolution, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever artifices they uſed, it was not poſſible for them to draw any thing more from the Princeſs, but that ſhe would deliver two or three ſmall places more to the King. And in truth, it was a ſtrange thing that the King wou'd not vigorouſly aſſiſt his Siſter upon cheaper terms, than by being abſolute maſter of all her domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and of the perſon of her Son. But this was the Cardinal's Maxim, who did not pretend to be a

To effect which, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and all his Country muſt be put into his hands, and then his advices would not be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Counſels, but Commands. Beſides, tho the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was Nephew to the King, yet it was not ſafe to repoſe too much confidence in the Cardinal, whoſe ambition had no bounds, and whoſe dark de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns 'twas impoſſible for any one to foreſee. 'Twas to no purpoſe to talk of the great affection which <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. had for his Siſter, and of the obligations both of conſcience and honour to protect her as well as his Nephew: All this ſerved for nothing without the Cardinal's concurrence, of which 'twas impoſſible to be ſecure.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal upon the point of his parting from <hi>Grenoble</hi> with the King, went to take his leave of the Dutcheſs, and<note n="*" place="margin">

But the Dutcheſs held faſt to her reſolutions not to diveſt herſelf of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and as this did not hinder the King from acting vigorouſly in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> if he were ſo minded, which was ſufficient to preſerve his Siſter and his Nephew, 'twas impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comprehend what ſhould incline him to deſire

               <p>Count <hi>Philip d' Aglie,</hi> who had confirmed the Dutcheſs in her opinion to keep <hi>Montmelian,</hi> incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no little danger upon this occaſion. The Dutcheſs was already got into her Coach to return to <hi>Savoy,</hi> and her Attendants were on Horſeback to follow her, when the Cardinal took the Count by the hand, and led him into a Chamber to diſcourſe him there in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Here ſqueezing his hand, and preſſing it hard againſt his breaſt, he frown'd upon him, and told him, <q>That now he might return in glory to <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſince he had engag'd the Dutcheſs by his Advice, to put the greateſt affront upon the King her Brother, and the greateſt diſappointment he could receive in the world, ſince people would now believe, that he came on purpoſe to talk with her, with a deſign to rob his Nephew of thoſe places, which he deſired with no other proſpect than only to keep them againſt his Enemies, and to force them to ſurrender the reſt they had taken from him.</q> The Count made anſwer, That he had no power over the Dutcheſs's inclinations; and the Cardinal replyed, that it were to be wiſhed that all the world did believe the ſame; after which he turned his back upon him. The Count took Horſe immediately, and without ſtopping at any place, never thought himſelf ſecure till he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to <hi>Montmelian.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Cardinal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far, that none of the <hi>Piedmonteſes</hi> were to tarry there, except the Marquis <hi>de St. Germain,</hi> and Count <hi>Cagnol</hi> his Lieutenant, and that the Garriſon ſhould be wholly compoſed of <hi>French,</hi> that were in the Service of the Houſe of <hi>Savoy.</hi>

               <p>In the mean time the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> died, and the Pope refuſed to ſay Maſs for his Soul, as 'tis the cuſtom, under a pretence that he had header an Army, which was compoſed in part of <hi>Lutheran</hi> Troops, againſt Catholicks. He likewiſe denied to ſhow him ſome other honours, that are accuſtomed to be paid to Cardinals. The Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> who commanded the Kings Fleet in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> had orders to go and take his place. He march'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, becauſe the Truce was ready to expire; and as ſoon as it was ended, he attacqu'd <hi>Quiers,</hi> in ſight of the Enemy's Army, who in vain endeavour'd to get thither before them. There were four hundred <hi>Germans</hi> in Garriſon, and three Hundred Horſe, who were reduced to capitulate the 28th of <hi>October,</hi> after ſome Vollies of Cannon had paſt between them. Next day the <hi>Spaniards</hi> advanced, as if they deſign'd to attacque the <hi>French</hi> Lines, but the latter marched out to meet them, and defeated five Squadrons of Horſe, who retreated in ſome diſorder under the Cannon of <hi>Villeneuve d' Aſti.</hi> The Count <hi>d' Harcourl</hi> being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to preſerve <hi>Quiers,</hi> during the Winter, tarried there ſo long to put it in a capacity of defending it ſelf, that proviſions began to fail him. In the mean time the Marquis <hi>de Legamez,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who had foreſeen this, poſted themſelves ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly, that nothing could come to him from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnole,</hi> and ſo reduc'd him to a neceſſity to paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their two Bodies, if he were minded to ſtay there no longer. But their precaution was in vain, for the Count ſlipt by them one night with ſo much order and ſpeed, that he had made the beſt part of his way, before the Enemy perceived it. Prince <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> who was firſt aware of them, deſign'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque the <hi>French</hi> in the Front, while the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as he imagined, would fall upon their Rear. But he was repulſed with loſs, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry, who came afterwards with full ſpeed, were conſtrain'd to return to the place from whence they came, without doing any thing. Thus the Count arrived at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnole</hi> without loſs, after this double Victory, but the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> was extremely blamed for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54967:124"/>ſo fair an opportunity. The Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had complain'd of him before, now had a freſh occaſion to complain of him, as of one that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to act with that promptitude and vigour which is requiſite in War. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſuſtain'd another loſs near <hi>Caſal,</hi> the Garriſon of which place, on the 29th of <hi>November,</hi> carry'd off five of their beſt Companies of Horſe; and ſo with this action the Campaign ended.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Maurice</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> finding there was no way to accommodate matters with their Siſter-in-law, publiſhed a Declaration, wherein they maintained themſelves to be the lawful Guardians of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> their Nephew, and acknowledged as ſuch by the Emperor, and by the Inhabitants of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont;</hi> ſo that they declared all thoſe perſons to be guilty of High Treaſon, that adhered to the Dutcheſs's party. But the Senate of <hi>Chambery</hi> cancell'd this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and the Dutcheſs publiſh'd another quite oppoſite to it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>France</hi> was engag'd in a<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi>'s life of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, <hi>l. 6. ch. 37.</hi>
                  </note> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as being very ill ſatisfied with its conduct for ſeveral reaſons.

The other was, the little notice the Pope took of the nomination his Majeſty had made in favour of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> for a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Cap. Beſides this, the Miniſter had not been able as yet to obtain his Bulls for his Dignity of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot-General of the Orders of the <hi>Ciſtercians</hi> and <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratenſes;</hi> and he had reaſon to complain of the manner the Pope had treated his Friend the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette.</hi> The firſt of theſe reaſons was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, why <hi>Scoti,</hi> the Popes Nuncio, who ſucceeded <hi>Bologuetti,</hi> was forbidden to have audience of the King. He had a Conference upon this affair with <hi>Chavigny,</hi> who particularly complain'd of the Aſſaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtrees</hi> Gentleman of the Horſe, and that the Pope had not permitted the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd ſervice to be celebrated for the Cardinal <hi>de
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54967:124"/>la Valette,</hi> as was uſual for the other Cardinals. The Nuncio denyed both one and the other, and began to complain that four or five Biſhops being aſſembled in <hi>Paris,</hi> had propoſed to have a National Council ſummon'd. He added, that if they came to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, he knew very well how to maintain the Intereſts of the Papal Chair, and that he did not doubt but the greateſt part of the Biſhops wou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for him. <hi>Chavigny</hi> deny'd the matter of fact, and wou'd have put a writing into <hi>Scoti</hi>'s hands, by which he was forbidden to come to the King's Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till his Majeſty had receiv'd ſatisfaction from him; but the Nuncio refuſing to receive it, <hi>Chavig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> deliver'd it to him by word of mouth. After ſome diſcourſe concerning a Peace, to which the Nuncio accuſed <hi>France</hi> to have an averſion, he told <hi>Chavigny</hi> that the menaces which the Cardinal <hi>de Richlieu</hi> made, no longer to acknowledge the Pope in <hi>France,</hi> but only as he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had firſt made uſe of violent ways, in ſtopping the Pope's Curriers, and hindering him <hi>(Scoti)</hi> to perform the functions of his Nunciature Ordinary and Extraordinary: That he had aſſembled ſome Biſhops at his Palace, to talk of convening a National Council, under pretence of <hi>Annates,</hi> and other pretended Grievances; that this was not the way to procure <hi>Mazarine</hi> a Cap; and that as for a National Council, the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> had too much zeal for the Holy See, of which they had given ſo many public teſtimonies, to engage in an affair of that nature. The Nuncio likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, that <hi>Chavigny</hi> had order'd Father <hi>Valerio,</hi> a Diſcalceated <hi>Carmelite,</hi> to tell him, nay, to ſend word of it to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the King might with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, if he pleas'd, revenge the death of <hi>Routray</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nuncio, by ſending the Mobb to inſult him in his houſe, or baſtinado him in the ſtreets; but that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54967:125"/>his Majeſty wou'd not make uſe of his power; and that he expected ſatisfaction from Cardinal <hi>Antonio Barberin. Chavigny</hi> denyed he ever ſaid any thing like it, but the Nuncio offering to ſend for Father <hi>Antonio,</hi> he told him there was no neceſſity for it, and began to make a Panegyric upon the Cardinal<note n="*" place="margin">See the Relation of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence on the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>Dec.</hi> in <hi>l. 2.</hi> of <hi>Aub.

               <p>As the Nuncio refuſed to receive from <hi>Chavigny</hi> the above-mentioned order in writing, which he tendred to him, <hi>Berliſe</hi> the Introductor of the Ambaſſadors, accompanied by an Uſher of the Privy Council, was ſent to give it him. The Nuncio refus'd it a ſecond time, nay, not only ſo, but wou'd not hear it read, and withdrew into another Chamber. <hi>Berliſe</hi> left it upon the Table, and charg'd the Nuncio's Officers to give it him, but as ſoon as the Introductor of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors was gone, they threw it back to him into his Coach. In the mean time, the King forbad all the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> to have any manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with <hi>Scoti,</hi> and every night a Guard was placed about his houſe, to hinder any one from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him.</p>

This year they took it in hand again, and the Marquis <hi>de Meilleraye</hi> had orders to open the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, on the ſide of <hi>Artois,</hi> with the Siege of this place. At the ſame time a ſmall body of men was given to the Marquis <hi>de Feuquieres,</hi> to enter into the Country of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> and attack <hi>Thionville.</hi>

He made ſo much haſte, and marched with ſo little noiſe, that he<note n="*" place="margin">The 7th of <hi>June.</hi>
                  </note> appear'd before the <hi>French</hi> thought he could have reach'd them, ſo that <hi>Feuquieres</hi> could not imagine who he was, when he ſaw his Colours. As he marched between the Woods, they could not judge what quarter he would attack, and all that the <hi>French</hi> General could do was to put his Army in Battel, in the different poſts where they ſtood, to be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to march, if there ſhould be occaſion. All this while <hi>Feuquieres</hi> was in an extraordinary perplexity, which made ſeveral Officers laugh who did not love him, and call'd him the <hi>Pedant,</hi> becauſe he was fitter
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54967:126"/>for Negotiation, than the Military profeſſion. In the mean time <hi>Picolomini</hi> gave the firſt onſet on that quarter which was poſted on the other ſide the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,</hi> which he carried after a vigorous oppoſition made by the Foot, for the Horſe run away. By this means <hi>Picolomini</hi> threw what ſuccors he pleas'd into <hi>Thionville,</hi> and then placed his Army in Battel Array, between the Counterſcarp of the place, and the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> without advancing further, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five a clock in the Afternoon. The <hi>French</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who had ſent his Artillery Horſes to <hi>Mets,</hi> was of the opinion to ſtay for them to carry him off, or at leaſt to defer the Retreat till night. But the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having approached a Ravelin, which parted the two Armies, with their Artillery, began to canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade the <hi>French,</hi> who likewiſe advanced on their ſide; tho for want of Horſes, they were not in a condition to bring up their Artillery. This gave the Enemy an opportunity to paſs the Ravelin, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> Infantry, who were, once more, in this extremity abandon'd by the Horſe. <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> as he perform'd all the Offices of a General, received two ſhots from a Muſquet, one of which broke his arm, ſo he was obliged to retire the diſtance of a Cannon ſhot from the place, where the action was. There he was taken Priſoner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Thionville,</hi> where he died in a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, partly of his wounds, and partly of grief. The <hi>French</hi> loſt few of their Horſe, becauſe they had the diſcretion to run away betimes, but their Infantry were half kill'd upon the ſpot, and half taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
               <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> to whom the Cardinal had given a ſmall Army, which he commanded upon the Frontiers of <hi>Champagne,</hi> was blamed for not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to the relief of <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> ſince he had notice of <hi>Picolomini</hi>'s March.

               <p>After this advantage, <hi>Picolomini</hi> judging that the <hi>French,</hi> diſpirited and terrified with this overthrow, would not be in a condition to oppoſe his deſigns, marched directly to<note n="*" place="margin">The Relation of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> in the <hi>Mem.</hi> of <hi>Aub.</hi> T. 2. p. 312.</note>

               <p>Before we paſs to the Affairs of State, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of War for the enſuing year, we muſt here take notice of ſome intrigues of Court, wherein the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had a much greater ſhare, than in the conduct of the Army. I have already ſpoken of the<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer. T. 2. l. 2. p. 555.</note> Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſs <hi>de Senecey,</hi> firſt Lady of Honour to the Queen, and of the great confidence that Princeſs repos'd in her. It was thirteen years ſince the Marchioneſs had enjoy'd that Poſt, and ſhe had always ſerv'd the Queen with an unſhaken fidelity, without purchaſing the Cardinals favour by betraying her Miſtreſs, as the greateſt part of the Courtiers us'd to do. The Cardinal, who was jealous leſt this Lady, who poſſeſt a great ſhare of vivacity and wit, would one day or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate into the Queen ſome deſigns contrary to his Miniſtry, reſolv'd to ruine her; and as the King impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly believ'd every thing he told him, he prevail'd with him to write a Letter to the Queen, wherein he ſent her word that for ſome important reaſons he found it convenient for her to diſmiſs the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>de Senecey. Chavigny</hi>

                     <hi>In</hi> Sept. 1639.</note> brought this Letter to the Queen as ſhe was ready to ſit down to dinner, and was juſt come from <hi>Notre Dame</hi> to acquit herſelf of a vow ſhe had made for the birth of the Dauphin.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54967:131"/>The Queen was exceedingly ſurpriz'd at this Order of the King, ſince it concern'd a Lady with whom ſhe had ſo much reaſon to be well ſatisfied, and cou'd not forbear to ſhew a great deal of concern for it: But at laſt ſhe ſaid ſhe was born to obey the King, and that ſhe would execute his Orders. She perceiv'd well enough from what quarter this ſtorm attackt her, and hoping that ſhe might perhaps bring the Cardinal to a better temper if ſhe addreſt herſelf to him, ſhe writ to him to interpoſe in this affair, and prevent the execution of what would give her ſo much diſturbance. But the Miniſter, who was not a man that would ſuffer himſelf to be wrought upon by pure civilities, ſent her word that he was much oblig'd to her Majeſty for the confidence ſhe ſeem'd to repoſe in him, but that he could not give her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advice than to obey the King. The Queen was extremely offended at this anſwer, and could not forbear to ſay, that it was not the King, but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, ſhe was forc'd to obey. So without taking the leaſt notice of her complaints, or ſo much as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting her with it, Madam <hi>de Senecey</hi>'s place was given to Madam <hi>de Braſſac,</hi> whom the Queen could not endure, becauſe ſhe was entirely in the intereſts of the Cardinal. For the ſame reaſons the Cardinal got the Baron <hi>de St. Ange,</hi> who was Comptroller of the Queens Houſhold, to be diſcarded. It ſeems he was afraid leſt the Queen, who was now become a Mother, might inſenſibly gain the good affections of the King, and at laſt prevail with his Majeſty to turn him off. To prevent which, he gave the King to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the Queen was exceſſively partial to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and engag'd him as much as he could, to mortifie that Princeſs; following his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Maxim, That a man ought not to have any confidence or friendſhip for thoſe whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he has often treated ill. However, to give the Queen ſome time to vent her paſſion, he order'd matters ſo, that under a pretence of hunting, the King came not nigh her for a long time.</p>
               <p>A little before this happen'd, the King ſeem'd to have an extraordinary kindneſs for Madam <hi>de Haute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:54967:132"/>after the retreat of Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Fayette;</hi> but the Cardinal did not think it worth his while then to croſs this new amour, becauſe ſhe was a Lady of a ſoft eaſie temper, and incapable of caballing. It was ſome years ago ſince the King had a reſpect for her, but he had diſcontinued for a long time to give her any marks of it. The Court was mightily ſurpriz'd at the Kings fondneſs, and knew not well what name to give it, for as on one ſide he ſeem'd to have a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful paſſion for thoſe of the fair Sex, ſo he was the coldeſt of all men living. Inſtead of ſeeking an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to entertain them in private, he never ſpoke to them but in the face of the whole Court, and in the Queens Apartment: and this Princeſs was ſo far from entertaining any jealouſie at it, that ſhe was extremely pleas'd that theſe Ladies drew the King to her Apartment, nay, what is more, ſhe made them her friends and confidents. 'Tis probable the King deſign'd no more than barely to amuſe himſelf with their converſation, to unbend himſelf from his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affairs. The Cardinal had at firſt without any diſtruſt beheld the eſteem which the King ſeem'd to have for Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> but he began to look with an ill eye upon it, when he found this Lady to be an intimate friend of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Chemeraut,</hi> who had infinitly more wit than ſhe, and was the fitteſt perſon in the world to ſuggeſt to her, what ſhe was to ſay to the King.</p>
               <p>To diſengage his Majeſty from theſe correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he ſuſpected, the Cardinal carried him to the frontiers of <hi>Artois</hi> and <hi>Champagne,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> to efface all theſe impreſſions. The Duke <hi>de S. Simon,</hi> who had been for ſome time a Favorite of the King, being remov'd from him, for ſome other reaſons, the Cardinal endeavor'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce into his place, <hi>Henri d' Effiat,</hi> Lord of <hi>Cinq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,</hi> Son to the Mareſchal <hi>d' Effiat,</hi> a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man full of wit, and handſomely made as to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He was Maſter of the Wardrobe, and after he was in favour, the Duke <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> ſurrender'd his place of Maſter of the Horſe to him. At firſt the King had an averſion to him, becauſe he behav'd
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54967:132"/>himſelf very negligently in his Office of Maſter of the Wardrobe, and had inclinations wholly different from thoſe of his Majeſty. However the Cardinal knew ſo well how to manage the King in favour of him, that the antipathy he ſeem'd to have for him, turn'd into an extraordinary friendſhip and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſo that he could not tarry a day without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. It was during the Siege of <hi>Hedin,</hi> that the King firſt began to ſhew him any marks of his favour; when he gave him a penſion of fifteen hundred Crowns, and ever ſince that time, he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himſelf without him. And now the King whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgot Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> in whoſe entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he only ſought to meet the ſame amuſement, as he found in that of his Favourite. After he was in bed, and all the company withdrawn out of the room, he cauſed him to ſit down by him, and would thus paſs two or three hours alone with him. Thus the Cardinal, by the means of this Favourite, knew all the Kings thoughts, and in the aſſurance that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came into his mind, which was diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Miniſtry, he govern'd the State with eaſe and tranquillity enough.</p>
               <p>As he had influenced the King to take a fancy to young <hi>d' Effiat,</hi> ſo he had alſo inſtructed the latter how to make himſelf be beloved, knowing perfectly what was moſt proper to gain the Kings friendſhip. However, leſt the ſight of Madam <hi>de Hautefort</hi> ſhould diminiſh this growing favour, the Cardinal ſtill found out one way or another to keep the King from <hi>Paris,</hi> as indeed he did the better part of this year. But at laſt the Kings Phyſicians did in private diſapprove of theſe long Journeys, and his Majeſty expreſſing a mighty deſire to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> that he might there divert himſelf in his Royal Houſes, it was not poſſible to detain him from it any longer. So he took the Road to <hi>Paris,</hi> while the Court was in great expectation to ſee who would carry it in the Kings favour. The Queen, according to his order, was at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> when he<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</note> arrived thither, and he ſaluted her with a coldneſs, which might have been expected from him, if he had parted from her
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54967:133"/>but a few hours before. As for Madam <hi>de Hautefort,</hi> who expected to be ſo mightily careſt by him, he ſcarce vouchſafed to look at her, and publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he would no longer have any conſideration for her. Nay, he told her in private, that he knew ſhe ſpoke ill of <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> but that ſhe had better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it, for he had infinitely a greater kindneſs for him than ever he had for her, or for any one in the world; and that he would find out a way to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine all thoſe that ſhould Cabal againſt him.</p>
               <p>This was a ſufficient indication with a witneſs how ſmall an eſteem the King had for this Lady; however leſt his affection ſhould break out afreſh, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſo order'd matters, that he commanded her, as well as Mademoiſelle <hi>de Chemeraut,</hi> to leave the Court. They went both to <hi>Paris,</hi> where they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried for ſome time in a Monaſtery of Nuns; but as they receiv'd too many viſits in that place, the ſecond had orders to retire into <hi>Poitou,</hi> and the other to be at leaſt forty leagues diſtance from <hi>Paris.</hi> The Queen was wonderfully concern'd at their harſh uſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had an extraordinary confidence in them, who for their part were thus cruelly treated for no other reaſon, but becauſe they were not dependents upon the Cardinal. After this manner, all thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were removed from the Queen, in whom ſhe could repoſe any truſt, leſt ſhe ſhould attempt any thing againſt the grandeur of the Miniſter; and this new Favourite ſerv'd to poſſeſs the King with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtories diſadvantageous to that Princeſs.</p>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54967:133"/>
                  <hi>Banier</hi> marched into <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and deſir'd the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> to come and joyn him, with a deſign to debauch the Army of the late Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and to engage them rather to ſerve the Crown of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> After ſeveral marches, <hi>Picolomini,</hi> who was come from the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and had joyn'd the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops, oblig'd the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate forces to joyn, as they did at the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> in order to attack them. <hi>Picolomini</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd upon the River <hi>Saal</hi> with fifteen thouſand men, and within a days march of him were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Bavarians,</hi> who ſecured to him the proviſions that came from <hi>Franconia.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> and <hi>Banier</hi> had thirty two thouſand men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to attack <hi>Picolomini:</hi> but they found him ſo well intrenched, that they durſt not attempt it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral marches and counter-marches there were on both ſides, without coming to a deciſive Battel, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho they had frequent Skirmiſhes. Towards the end of the Campaign, the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> falling ſick, left the Command of the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> falling ſick, left the Command of the Army to the Count <hi>de Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briant.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> mightily ſuſpected that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had a mind to debauch their Army, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> on their ſide were jealous, that the <hi>French</hi> deſigns had no other end but the grandeur of their own Country. Thus theſe reciprocal ſuſpicions, joyn'd to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſentiments concerning the marching of the Army, hinder'd them from performing any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable action.</p>
               <p>On the ſide of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> had orders to go and beſiege <hi>Charlemont</hi> upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and he marcht thither at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May,</hi> but the rains were ſo exceſſive that he durſt not continue his march, in a Country, where he could expect neither Victuals nor For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Orders of the Court were preciſe, and the Cardinal would never ſuffer any difficulties to be ſtarted, after he had once projected a thing. Upon this the Council of War reſolved to ſend him a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the inſuperable difficulties that attended this deſign, and ſo it was laid aſide. But ſoon after another deſign was laid againſt <hi>Arras,</hi> a place of far
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54967:134"/>greater importance, where they thought to ſucceed much eaſier than in the former. The principal diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that offer'd it ſelf was, to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from diſcovering their deſign, and throwing ſuccors into the place. For this reaſon they came to a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> ſhould march ſtrait to <hi>Bethune,</hi> as if he deſign'd to beſiege that place, and that the Mareſchal <hi>de Meilleraye</hi> ſhould follow him by ſmall Journeys, as it were to ſupport him, but that ſo ſoon as the latter was arrived at <hi>Bapaume,</hi> he ſhould turn directly to <hi>Arras,</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> ſhould do the ſame on his ſide. This was ſo happily executed, that the two Armies appear'd before <hi>Arras</hi> on the 12th of <hi>June,</hi> before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were able to penetrate into their deſign. A few days after the Army received the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys and Artillery, for which they had occaſion, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not in a condition to hinder it. The <hi>Count d' Iſemburg,</hi> Governor of the place, who happen'd to be abſent, endeavour'd in vain to get into it, when the Siege was once form'd, and he was obliged to leave the care of his defence to <hi>Eugenius Buel,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Colonel, who commanded in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. General <hi>Lambos,</hi> who was incamp'd within a league and half of the place, in a very advantageous poſt, did likewiſe vainly attempt to throw ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief into the Town, being defeated by the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye.</hi> In the mean time, notwithſtanding the vigorous defence of the Garriſon, the place was every day more and more ſtrained, ſo that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Infanta was forced to march in perſon to relieve it, and form'd a Camp at <hi>Mount de S. Eloi,</hi> in a place eaſy to be defended, and which was ſeparated from the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi>'s quarter by a plain of about a league over. The <hi>French</hi> could not receive their proviſions but from a great way off, and part of their Troops muſt of neceſſity leave their Lines to go and meet them. Altho they did not ſtand in want of them as yet, yet fearing the Siege would employ them ſome time, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themſelves with new Troops, the Mareſchals preſt the Court to ſen them a Convoy without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54967:134"/>lay, and concerted their meaſures for this with the Cardinal. The Convoy being ready to depart, the Cardinal gave orders to <hi>Du Hallier</hi> to guard it, but at the ſame time the King forbid him to advance, without ſaying a word to the Miniſter. This Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was founded upon a fear of his Majeſty, that in caſe <hi>Du Hallier</hi> and the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> who was to meet him, happen'd to be defeated, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would break into the bowels of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and occaſion great diſorders there. But than he ran a great hazard too, to leave the Army which beſieged <hi>Arras,</hi> in imminent deſtruction, to ſave the Body which <hi>Du Hallier</hi> commanded. When <hi>Choupes</hi> brought him an order from the Cardinal, he made a thouſand difficulties, that he might not march. But at laſt, when <hi>Choupes</hi> aſſured him that he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Cardinal for his conduct, and that he muſt expect to take upon himſelf the ill ſucceſs of the Siege, in caſe it miſcarry'd, <hi>Du Hallier</hi> reſolved to obey the Cardinal rather than the King, and ſo the Convoy arrived happily to the Camp. This oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Du Hallier,</hi> who had preſum'd for ſome time, to ballance the Cardinal's Orders with thoſe of the King, was the reaſon why he could not obtain a Mareſchal's Staff till long after.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having receiv'd advice, that the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> was gone out of the Camp with three thouſand Horſe, and three thouſand Foot, attacked the <hi>French</hi> Lines, which were double, and forced the firſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the reſiſtance the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> could make. After this they went on to force the ſecond, ſo that being ſupported by a vigorous Sally from the Garriſon, they had infallibly reliev'd the place, if the <hi>French</hi> going out of their ſecond Line, had not fallen upon them in the Flank, and made them think of a Retreat. In the heat of the Fight the Mareſehal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> arrived, and about half an hour after <hi>du Hallier;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ſeeing ſo great a number of Troops march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, were obliged to retire, leaving twelve hundred of their men dead in the <hi>French</hi> Lines. The

                  <hi>French</hi> loſt about half the number, but for their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, after they had made conſiderable breaches in the place, they forced it to ſurrender on the 10th of <hi>Auguſt. St. Preuil</hi> Captain of the Guards, who had ſignalized his bravery in the Siege, was made Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Town. By this Conqueſt, <hi>Picardy,</hi> which before was expoſed on all ſides to the inroads of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was ſufficiently cover'd on that ſide; and on the contrary, <hi>Flanders</hi> lay open to the <hi>French</hi> Armies, which has ſince cauſed infinite loſſes to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> However, the <hi>French</hi> Army was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fatigu'd by this Siege, that they were not in a condition to make any farther attempts in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> this Campaign.</p>
               <p>On the ſide of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> a fair opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf to <hi>France,</hi> to make a much larger breach in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy.<note place="margin">

               <p>The Hoſtages departed ſhortly after with <hi>Villaplena,</hi> a <hi>Catalonian,</hi> and <hi>Du Pleſſis,</hi> and the firſt having left them with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and conferr'd with him, return'd to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> while the other purſued his way to the Court, to inſtruct the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal in what condition the <hi>Catalonians</hi> were.

                  <hi>Bezancon,</hi> who tarried all this while at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> at laſt concluded the Treaty with the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> and ſent it to the Cardinal, who could ſcarce believe it was true, of ſo prodigious an importance did he look upon this Revolution to be. He afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the Title of Lieutenant General upon <hi>Bezan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> who being now arrived at <hi>Tarragone,</hi> propoſed to <hi>d' Eſpenan</hi> to march out with his Horſe, and come to joyn his Infantry, which was incamp'd within ſeven or eight leagues of him, and there to ſtay in ſome advantageous poſt for the arrival of the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Train-bands, that were gathering together in all parts, while the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Regiment of <hi>St. Olaric,</hi> with two Companies of Light Horſe defended <hi>Tarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,</hi> as very well they might. He repreſented to him how dangerous it was for a General of an Army
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54967:136"/>to be locked up in ſo bad a place as that was: But <hi>d' Eſpenan</hi> would not liſten to this wholſome advice, but ſent to him to order the <hi>French</hi> Foot to advance immediately, and to preſs the <hi>Catalonians</hi> to put themſelves in a condition to make a vigorous reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

The ſecond, That D. <hi>Juan</hi> was not to ſleep upon this happy ſucceſs which he met with at firſt, but make all neceſſary preparations out of hand to offer War to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> both by Sea and by Land, and to ſupport himſelf by Alliances with thoſe that were inclin'd to favour his cauſe.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince the beginning of the ſame year, the<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mem. Rec.

Feragelli</hi> the Pope's Secretary, who was come to <hi>Turin</hi> to aſſiſt the Nuncio in perſwading the different parties to a Peace, did likewiſe propoſe a Truce for ſome years between <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Milaneſe;</hi> and altho the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> ſeem'd diſpoſed to accept of it, yet he made great preparations to take the Field, before the <hi>French</hi> recruits could paſs the Mountains. The <hi>French</hi> too on their ſide uſed all imaginable diligence, and were not behind the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in talking of a Peace or a Truce.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:54967:137"/>
               <p>All theſe diſcourſes only tended to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves odious to one another, and to lull one another aſleep if it were poſſible. The Cardinal was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> in particular only talked of an accommodation to ingratiate himſelf with the People of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who had this long while lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for a Peace, and to make his Siſter-in-law odious to them. He ſent therefore to acquaint her, that this Prince kept a private correſpondence with ſome Officers of her Houſhold. The Prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make a Treaty with her by herſelf, without having regard to the Intereſts of <hi>France;</hi> but ſhe ſcornfully rejected this Propoſal, as ſhe herſelf related the ſtory to <hi>de la Cour,</hi> adding that ſhe was reſolved to follow the Cardinal's advice, altho he had treated her with a great deal of rigour at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and that ſhe would not ceaſe to love him, as much as the King did, and as much as ſo great, and ſo excellent a Miniſter deſerved.</p>

In the beginning of his Letter he aſſured her, that the King deſired nothing more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly than to ſee her well re-eſtabliſhed in her Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and maintain a good intelligence with her Brothers-in-law; that his Majeſty would be always ready to reſtore back the places which he held in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> aſſoon as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would fairly part with what they had in their poſſeſſion, ſo that the Dutcheſs might for the future remain abſolute Miſtreſs of them; That nevertheleſs the ſecurity of her perſon, and that of the Duke her Son, being the principal cauſe which ought to be conſidered, the King would never conſent, that either one or the other, ſhould fall into the hands of thoſe perſons, whoſe intereſt obliged them to deſtroy both.</p>
               <p>While the <hi>French</hi> were thus negotiating with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> held a cloſe corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and it was with her conſent, that the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the Siege of <hi>Caſal.</hi> He began to inveſt this place on the 8th of <hi>April,</hi> with fourteen thouſand Foot, and five thouſand Horſe, at a juncture when the <hi>French</hi> were ſcarce able to defend the Cittadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> againſt Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who attack'd it on the ſide of the Town. The Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> did earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that he would have helped them to take this Cittadel, becauſe by the reducing of it they had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually eſtabliſh'd their authority in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which muſt needs be in a tottering condition, ſo long as the Cittadel of the Capital City held out for the Duke their Nephew. Beſides this, they could not behold <hi>Caſal</hi> in the hands of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without extreme regret. But the very ſame reaſons perſwaded <hi>Leganez</hi> to undertake this Siege, and puſh it on with all imaginable vigour, becauſe it was of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to <hi>Spain</hi> that theſe Princes ſhould be ſtill dependent upon that Crown, and <hi>Caſal</hi> was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to retain the people of <hi>Piedmont</hi> in their duty. Nor was this all, for he began to ſuſpect theſe Princes,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54967:138"/>for the frequent propoſals of Accommodation they made to their Siſter-in-law; and was of opinion that the only reaſon why they ſo much deſired to have the Cittadel of <hi>Turin</hi> in their hands, was that they might compound more advantageouſly for themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any conſideration to the Intereſts of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the motives which engaged <hi>Leganez</hi> to undertake the Siege of <hi>Caſal,</hi> againſt the ſentiments of the greateſt part of the Officers of his Army, who did not look upon him to be ſtrong enough for ſuch an attempt. He mightily depended upon a ſecret intelligence he held in the place, but it fell out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily for him, that <hi>de la Tour</hi> the Governor of that City, diſcovered it, and put every thing in ſuch good order betimes, that he muſt expect to reduce it no other way but by main force. At the ſame time the Governor having given the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> advice of this deſign, that General uſed all his endeavours to bring his Troops together aſſoon as he was able, in order to raiſe the Siege, and at the ſame time ſent word to the Court, that he was reſolved to put this enterprize in execution, or elſe to dye before the place. He likewiſe demanded, that the Troops which were deſign'd for <hi>Piedmont,</hi> ſhould inſtantly advance, and that they would take care to furniſh him with all things neceſſary for a Campaign. The Cardinal was at a Play when this news came to him, and was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the boldneſs of the undertaking, however he did not think fit to diſſwade him from it; on the other hand he told <hi>Correro,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſador who ſate near him, that he would not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to give the Count any farther advice about it; that the thing was already done, and that he had great reaſon to hope good ſucceſs from it, by reaſon of the good conduct and bravery of the General. Thus the Count having received a promiſe at <hi>Pignerol</hi> to be immediately relieved, marched with ſeven thouſand Foot, three thouſand Horſe, and ten pieces of Cannon directly to <hi>Caſal,</hi> altho the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were almoſt double the number. The Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> had not as yet compleated his Lines of Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54967:139"/>when he receiv'd advice that the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> was coming towards him. Upon this he orders ſome Pioneers out of the <hi>Milaneze</hi> with all ſpeed to labour on the Works, and in the mean time embarks his heavy Baggage and Artillery, to be carried by the <hi>Po</hi> to <hi>Breme,</hi> in caſe he ſhould not be able to oblige the <hi>French</hi> to retire. He likewiſe attack'd the Caſtle of <hi>Roſſignan,</hi> within ſome leagues of <hi>Caſal,</hi> but his men were repulſed with loſs. The Count's Army appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 28th of <hi>April,</hi> and skirmiſhed with the Advance Guards of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take a view of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lines on the ſide of <hi>Fraſſinet.</hi> He attack'd them the next day, after he had beaten off ſome Troops that would have hinder'd his paſſage over the <hi>Gattola,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Po</hi> near <hi>Fraſſinet.</hi> He made three attacks, one of which was commanded by the Viſcount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> the other by the Count <hi>du Pleſſy-Pralain,</hi> and the third by <hi>la Mothe Houdancourt. Du Pleſſy-Pralain</hi> thrice attack'd the Lines of the Enemy on his ſide, but he was as often repulſed, by reaſon of the great depth of the Ditch. But the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> finding it eaſier to effect it upon the left, where he was, puſhed his Horſe forward with that vigour, that he was the firſt that leapt into the Enemy's Lines; but thoſe that were to have followed him, being not ſo well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could not enter along with him, ſo that for ſome time he found himſelf all alone expoſed to the firing of the Enemy. In the mean time <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Mothe</hi> found a more eaſie place to paſs over, within ſome paces of it, and entred with his Cavalry, to which the Count went and joyn'd himſelf. At the head of this Body he charged the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe with ſo much impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that they immediately gave way. He had his Horſe kill'd under him in this occaſion, but was ſoon re-mounted upon one belonging to a Captain of the Light Horſe, whom he took Priſoner with his own hand. Not long after, as he purſued the Enemy down their Line, his Horſe ſtuck faſt in a miry ditch, ſo that he was not able to diſengage himſelf from this embarras, but by leaving one of his Boots, his Hat, and one of his Piſtols behind him. Being once more
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54967:139"/>re-mounted, he continued to beat back the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> that they might not have time to recover their diſorder. <hi>Turenne</hi> and <hi>Pralain</hi> on their ſide return'd with their Foot to give the fourth Charge, and forced the Lines, after which they bore down all they met, notwithſtanding all the fire which the Enemy made upon them. The Cavalry of the Beſieged did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe joyn that of the Count, and then the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> thought of nothing but how to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to <hi>Fraſſinet;</hi> which he performed with a body of four thouſand Horſe, and by that means gave his Foot an opportunity to draw off; and as part of them had not been concerned in the battel, they might have made a Body ſufficient to repel the <hi>French,</hi> in caſe they had had time to range themſelves in Battel, but they purſu'd them ſo near, that they put them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Several of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of fear threw themſelves into the <hi>Po,</hi> where great numbers of them were drown'd, and the night ſaved the reſt. Others withdrew in the ſame confuſion to <hi>Pouteſture,</hi> and had no better luck. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt five thouſand men in this rencounter, eight pieces of Cannon, ſix Mortars, all their Ammunition, which themſelves ſet on fire, and a great part of their Baggage. <hi>Leganez</hi> had not ſo much precaution as to ſave his Papers, ſo that there was found in his Tent the ſecret Treaty he had made with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> concerning <hi>Caſal,</hi> and ſome Lands which the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> held in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and he thought to have taken from them. The Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> in this occaſion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the reputation of one of the braveſt and moſt reſolute Generals which <hi>France</hi> had ſent out of a long time, altho in reality this was a very raſh action. The importance of the place which he ſaved, made the world willing to excuſe a boldneſs which would have been blamed in any other occaſion.

               <p>At the ſame time the Cardinal<note n="*" place="margin">The 21ſt of <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note> writ a very earneſt Letter to her, wherein he ſhew'd her the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice ſhe would do the Duke her Son, and herſelf, if ſhe engag'd in any negotiation with the Princes her Brothers-in-law, while they were maſters of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin;</hi> and the great danger ſhe run if ſhe went into <hi>Piedmont</hi> for that end, as they deſired her, at a time when they were too ſtrong for her there.

               <p>A few days after<note n="*" place="margin">The 28th of <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note>, inſtructions were ſent to the Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> to let him know that he was to reject all propoſals of Peace from Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> till ſuch time as <hi>Turin</hi> was re-taken; that if he could take <hi>Turin</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> himſelf, without too much expoſing the Kings Army, he ſhould undertake that before any expedition whatever; but if he ſaw he ſhould run too great a riſque, he might enter into
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54967:140"/>ſome compoſition, provided his Majeſty's Troops were receiv'd into <hi>Turin,</hi> and the Authority of his Miniſters and Generals was not limited there, any more than that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the places they had taken.

               <p>In the mean time the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> was ſo far from following the Cardinal's advice, in relation to the Troops ſhe was to ſend to the Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> that ſhe kept even thoſe that were in his Majeſty's pay, near her perſon, as if ſhe had been afraid that the <hi>French</hi> Army had made too great a progreſs.

               <p>The Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> after he had deliver'd <hi>Caſal</hi> in ſo glorious a manner, now bethought himſelf of executing the orders he had received to beſiege <hi>Turin,</hi> and he marched thither with ſo great diligence, that on the 9th of <hi>May</hi> he came in ſight of the place.

               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:54967:141"/>
               <p>The Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> having received advice at <hi>Verceil,</hi> whether he retired after his defeat, of the Count's deſigns, advanced in hopes to retaliate his late beating, and on the 26th encamped on the other ſide the <hi>Po,</hi> upon the Hills near <hi>Quiers,</hi> with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe. After he had at his leiſure viewed the <hi>French</hi> Lines, he believ'd it was not poſſible to force them, and that it would be better for him to endeavour to cut off their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to oblige them to raiſe the Siege for fear of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which he hoped would ſoon make their Camp uneaſy to them. Thus on the 9th of <hi>July</hi> he order'd twelve hundred men to paſs the <hi>Po</hi> near <hi>Montcalier,</hi> where they retrenched themſelves to hinder any Victuals from coming to them that way. But ſoon after the Vicount <hi>de Turenne</hi> attacked them, forced them, cut one half of them in pieces, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the reſt to ſwim the <hi>Po,</hi> into which they threw themſelves in great confuſion. This Poſt, as it was of the laſt conſequence to the deſign of <hi>Leganez,</hi> he came up thither with his whole Army, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the efforts of the <hi>French,</hi> yet they were not able to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> quit it. By this means he ſhut up the paſſage for all manner of relief and proviſions, that could come by the way of <hi>Pignerol.</hi> After this he ſent <hi>D. Charles de la Gatta,</hi> to poſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at <hi>Colegno,</hi> to block up the way of <hi>Suza,</hi> leſt the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be relieved that way. In a ſhort time the Proviſions in the Camp were all conſumed, and the Army was forced to ſubſiſt upon thoſe that were in the Magazines in the Cittadel; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> were in danger, if they were not ſpeedily relieved, to periſh by Famine, and to abandon <hi>Turin.</hi> The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had their Victuals diſtributed among them with great Oeconomy, when they receiv'd advice that ſuccours were arriv'd at <hi>Pignerol.</hi> This hope made the Souldiers combat with equal bravery againſt the Sallies of the Beſieged, which were often very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and againſt the worſt of enemies, Famine. It was an inexcuſable overſight in the Chief Miniſter not to have prevented this inconvenience, by making timely Magazines for proviſions at <hi>Pignerol</hi> or <hi>Suza.</hi>

                  <hi>Leganez</hi> being inform'd of the arrival of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, was afraid they would force their paſſage, and ſo render all his labours ineffectual: For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he reſolved to give a general Aſſault to the <hi>French</hi> Lines, while Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould make a vigorous Sally. To effect this, they aſſign'd the 11th of <hi>July,</hi> and <hi>Leganez</hi> was to attack the Count's Quarter, while <hi>La Gatta</hi> fell upon that of <hi>La Mothe.</hi> The latter had then four thouſand Foot, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred Horſe; and the Marquis had the ſame number of Horſe, and five thouſand Foot.</p>
               <p>The day being come, <hi>La Gatta,</hi> without ſtaying for the hour appointed, attackt the Quarter of <hi>La Mothe,</hi> fill'd up his Ditches, and broke in with his Body into the <hi>French</hi> Lines; but inſtead of beating them, as he had begun, along the Circumvallation, and hindering <hi>La Mothe</hi> from rallying, he march'd ſtrait into the City with two hundred Horſe and a thouſand Foot, without troubling himſelf whether the Enemy made any oppoſition againſt thoſe that followed him. In the mean time, <hi>La Mothe</hi> having rallied his Troops, cut the reſt in pieces, and defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe that conducted the Powder and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>La Gatta</hi> was to throw into <hi>Turin,</hi> and which they wanted more than they did men. Thoſe that eſcaped ſav'd themſelves in diſorder at <hi>Colegno;</hi> and thus for want of diſcretion in this General, they loſt a fair opportunity of utterly ruining the <hi>French</hi> Army. As for the Marquis <hi>de Leganez,</hi> it was too late before he attack'd the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi>'s Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and after he had ſpent four hundred Cannon-ſhot all the day long againſt it, he was twice repulſed, nay, and purſued by the <hi>French</hi> out of their Lines. However, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>La Gatta</hi> made a Sally with four hundred Foot, and twelve hundred Horſe, and made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Valentin;</hi> which news being brought to <hi>Leganez,</hi> he brought his men back again to the Onſet: But the Count, who had ſeen by the preceding Attacks that there was little danger to apprehend from ſo harmleſs an Enemy, ſent part of his Souldiers againſt Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and at the ſame time ſuſtain'd the attack of <hi>Leganez,</hi> and forc'd
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54967:142"/>the Prince to retire into the Town again. He for his part complain'd that <hi>Leganez</hi> had not given him the Signal that was agreed upon, when he attackt the <hi>French,</hi> that ſo he might have made a vigorous Sally againſt them at the ſame time, as was projected: But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſaid that the diſcharge of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and Muſquet ſhot might eaſily have made Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> to comprehend when their attack be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>

               <p>Towards the end of this year, the<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mem.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54967:143"/>had it then in his thoughts to deſtroy the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Religion entirely, and that he had explain'd himſelf upon this Chapter more than once to Chancellor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier.</hi> He propos'd to have a Conference with the Miniſters, wherein he hoped to carry them whither he pleaſed. But leſt it ſhould have the ſame ſucceſs with the famous Conference of <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> he was reſolved to ſecure himſelf before-hand of fourſcore Miniſters, who, joyn'd to thoſe that perhaps might ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be reduced by his arguments, would bring over, as he imagined, the greateſt part of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi> As for the reſt, he pretended to employ the Royal Authority, and ſo either make Proſelytes of them by dint of ill uſage, or if he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accompliſh his end, to turn them out of the Kingdom. He believed that very few Families would rather chuſe to abandon their native Country, and ſee their admiſſion into it for ever lock'd up againſt them, than to embrace the Catholick Religion; That it would be a difficult matter for them to reſolve to wander like fugitives through the World, to find out a ſanctuary to receive them: That they would find inſuperable hardſhips in ſelling off their goods, either becauſe there would not be buyers enough to take them off their hands, or becauſe they muſt be forced to part with them at too low a price; That altho there might be ſome reaſon to ſuſpect the ſincerity of the New Converts, yet their Children, ſucking the Catholic Religion with their Milk, would be really perſwaded of the truth of it. The better to effect this deſign, he was of opinion that this Aſſembly was to be prevail'd upon in the firſt place to declare, that a man might be ſaved in both Churches. Becauſe if the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were once ſatisfied of that, they would ſooner chuſe to turn Catholics, ſo to avoid the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they were to ſuffer, if they ſtill continued in their <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> than blindly to adhere to the latter, by rejecting a Religion, wherein nevertheleſs they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that a man might be ſaved. After this manner did this Miniſter reaſon, who imagin'd that other people had no more Religion than himſelf. Part of this project has been ſince followed in <hi>France,</hi> and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54967:144"/>we find by experience, that contrary to what the Cardinal expected, a prodigious number of Families thought it better to leave the Kingdom than to turn. Thoſe perſons that have ſtudied theſe matters a little, know that the generality of mankind are ſtrangely wedded to the opinions they learnt in their infancy, eſpecially when they appear to be more conſonant to reaſon, and more agreeable to truth, than the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite doctrines which ſome people would have them embrace. But this was the Cardinals blind ſide, and his Talent did not lye in theſe ſort of ſpeculations.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe fell upon another<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> project, no leſs difficult to be effected than the former, and that was to make himſelf Patriarch of <hi>France.</hi> He thought himſelf already ſecur'd of the greateſt part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and to bring the Monks over to his ſide he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be Abbot General of the three moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Orders, that ſo he might have wherewithal to gain the ſuffrages of the Religious. But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> being throughly ſatisfied of his ambitious deſigns, he could never procure his Bulls, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his inſtances and ſollicitations to obtain them; ſo that wholly deſpairing to compaſs his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, this fancy left him, or at leaſt he carried it with him to the grave. Thus he never thought any more of this project, for in truth it requir'd another ſort of a man than himſelf; who, as he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hated, ſo he had moſt infallibly periſh'd under the weight of this attempt; which, tho he had been poſſeſſed of the love and eſteem of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he would have found a moſt difficult matter to have ever accompliſh'd.</p>
               <p>On the 21ſt of <hi>September</hi> the King had another Son, who was call'd at firſt the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the death of <hi>Gaſton,</hi> had the Title of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans.</hi> The Queen had not a jot the more authority for this; Nay, 'tis confidently ſaid, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer.

                  <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> to deliver it to his Majeſty. The King having read the Cardinals Letter, thus directed himſelf to the Maſter of the Horſe, <hi>The Cardinal has here ſent me word,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that you have teſtified a great deſire to comply with me in every thing, and yet you don't amend as to one particular,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54967:145"/>which I deſired him to re-mind you of, and that is your idleneſs.</hi> Inſtead of promiſing the King that he would amend that fault for the future, <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> anſwer'd that he could not reform as to that point. Upon this the King replyed, <hi>A man of your condition, who ought to render himſelf worthy to command an Army, and who has aſſured me that he deſign'd ſuch a thing, muſt above all things avoid Idleneſs, as altogether deſtructive to his reputation. Cinq-Mars</hi> bluntly anſwer'd, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any pretenſions that way, and the King main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the contrary; after which he proceeded in his diſcourſe, telling him that Idleneſs made a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of every thing that was commendable; that it was only good for the people of <hi>Mavais,</hi> among whom he was bred up, who entirely abandon'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their pleaſures; and that if he deſign'd to continue that ſort of life, he muſt return to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Maſter of the Horſe replied in a great heat, that he was ready to return thither. <hi>Well,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>if I were not wiſer than you, I know what anſwer I ſhould return to what you have ſaid.</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> having thoſe great obligations to him which he had, ought not to treat him after ſuch a faſhion; when the Maſter of the Horſe, with his uſual good addreſs and civility anſwer'd, that as he was always ready to ſerve the King, ſo he was as ready to leave him; and that he ſhould be full as content to be <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> as <hi>Monſieur le Grand,</hi> and that he could not change his way of living. The King and he continu'd to pique at one another all the way to the Caſtle, till they arriv'd in the very Court, where the King told him, that conſidering the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour he was in at preſent, he would mightily oblige him not to come near him. So the Maſter of the Horſe withdrew, and did not appear before the King for ſome days.</p>
               <p>One may ſee by this boyſterous and inſolent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> was not born to continue long in this advantageous Poſt to which the Cardinal got him advanced; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. was not a Prince extremely impatient, ſince he could ſuffer a young fellow to talk to him after ſuch a manner. In the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54967:145"/>mean time the<note n="*" place="margin">Aub. ib.</note> Cardinal took care to appeaſe the Kings anger, at the repeated inſtances of <hi>Cinq-Mars;</hi> and the King and his Favourite liv'd together as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. The Miniſter was extremely glad to make the Favourite every day more and more dependant upon himſelf, in becoming wholly neceſſary to him to maintain him in the Kings favour. By this means he continued to know all his Majeſty's ſecret thoughts, who, reſerved and cloſe as he was in relation to all others, yet frequently open'd the moſt hidden incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his Soul to his Favourites. Nay, tho he was never ſo much minded to conceal what lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, yet his Favourites, by putting him upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſubjects, were able to ſound his true ſentiments, notwithſtanding all the diſſimulation he was maſter of; ſo that the Cardinal being perfectly inform'd of all occurrences, knew how to regulate his conduct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Altho the King intruſted him with the adminiſtration of all his affairs, yet he was deſirous to be made acquainted with every thing, and could not forbear to expreſs his diſpleaſure, if he knew that any thing was kept hid from him; or at leaſt he ſhew'd his diſſatisfaction, when he entertain'd himſelf in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate with his Favourites; and the Cardinal took care to appeaſe him by ſome flatteries, which he mingled, as he ſaw convenient, in his diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer. T. 2. p. 563.</note>
                  <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> being thus reconciled to the King, imagined now that he had nothing more to fear, tho his Majeſty expreſsly told him, that if the Cardinal once came to be againſt him, he would abandom him for ever. The King having taken care that thoſe that were about him ſhould acquaint the Cardinal with all that he ſaid, was ſometimes diſpleas'd to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf encompaſs'd by Spies: but the great occaſion he had for his Miniſtry, and the high eſteem he had for his capacity, hindered him from removing theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from him, altho he did by no means affect them. However, that he might have one near his perſon, to whom he might freely open his ſentiments, he made the Maſter of the Horſe ſwear to him, that he would never acquaint the Cardinal with what he ſhould tell him. This Miniſter was ſoon ſenſible that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54967:146"/>Maſter of the Horſe did not come, as he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, to inform him of what paſt near the King, ſo he began at firſt to ſuſpect him, and at laſt form'd a deſign to ruine him, on the very firſt occaſion that preſented it ſelf. The Cardinal's Enemies having obſerved the coldneſs between them, did not fail to inſinuate into the Maſter of the Horſe, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was ill affected to him, and only wanted a fair opportunity to deſtroy him. <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> who on his ſide did not naturally love his Benefactor, look'd upon his Grandeur as an obſtacle to his own, and did him no more good offices to his Majeſty. This Prince being now ſatisfied, that <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> carried no more tales to the Cardinal, had a greater affection for him than ever, and reſolved to have him admitted into the Privy Council. One day when he was at <hi>Rethel,</hi> the Councellors entred the Council Chamber with the Cardinal, to hold a Council there, and as the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers withdrew to leave them their places, and <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> follow'd them, the King ſtopt him, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf towards the Cardinal, <hi>That my dear friend here,</hi> ſays he, meaning the Maſter of the Horſe, <hi>may be able to ſerve me one day, I think it convenient that he ſhould without further delay inſtruct himſelf in the affairs of my Council.</hi> The Cardinal, who knew well enough that it was to no purpoſe for him directly to oppoſe the Kings pleaſure, did not ſhow the leaſt reſentment at that time, and ſo held a Council, but took care that nothing of importance ſhould be there propoſed. But the day following, he repreſented to the King, the ill effects ſuch an innovation as this might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and the great injury he did his own reputation, as well as that of the Council, if it ſhould be ſaid that nothing of any conſequence could be debated there, unleſs ſuch a young man as the Maſter of the Horſe, was one of the number. This remonſtrance of the Cardinal made ſo deep an impreſſion upon the King, that he did not permit <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Council Chamber any more.</p>
               <p>From that time the ſecret hatred which the Maſter of the Horſe bore the Cardinal, broke out in public, and thoſe occaſions of diſcontent which this Miniſter
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54967:146"/>lately gave him, wrought a greater force upon the mind of an ambitious young man, than all the ſervices he had formerly done him. However, the King labour'd to reconcile them, and outwardly they ſeem'd to be as hearty friends as ever. But ſoon after they fell out, and the occaſion aroſe from the Favourite's deſiring the King to make him a Duke and a Peer, that he might marry the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who would not accept of him but upon that condition. Having open'd this affair to the Cardinal, who he fooliſhly imagin'd would comply with his deſires, this Miniſter tax'd him with imprudence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, ſetting before his eyes what he had done to raiſe his Father and himſelf from the ſimple rank of Gentlemen, to the preſent degree of honour they enjoy'd. <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> who was of no leſs haughty a Spirit than the Cardinal, could not hear him talk thus but with the greateſt indignation, and began to cabal with all his power, to ruine his Patron and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. He engag'd in his Intereſts <hi>Francis de Thou,</hi> Son to the famous <hi>James Auguſtin de Thou.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer: T. 2. p. 567.</note> He was a moſt accompliſh'd man in reſpect of all thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that are requir'd in a Gentleman of the Long Robe, and being either a relation or a friend to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of thoſe that reſented the effects of the Cardinals hatred, beſides that this Miniſter had hinder'd him from being made one of the Councellors of State; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had for ſome time conſider'd of the matter, at laſt eſpouſed the party of the Maſter of the Horſe, and engaged the Dukes of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Bouillon</hi> to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his deſigns. There was the greater probability of ſucceeding, becauſe rhe King had expreſſed himſelf to be particularly deſirous of a Peace, to put an end to all thoſe calamities and diſorders, which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſts of his Miniſter had ſtirr'd up in the Kingdom. The King had likewiſe frown'd upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Cardinals creatures, whom he did indeed eſteem and fear, but did not really love at the bottom: As for <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> he was now perfectly in the Kings favour, and this brought abundance of perſons over to his party.</p>

He likewiſe ordained, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament every three months ſhould give the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor an account of what they did, and every year take out a permiſſion from his Majeſty to continue in their reſpective functions. By this the King abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the authority of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> as if they had abuſed their power, by oppoſing the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary proceedings of the Cardinal. This Prince it ſeems imagined, that only himſelf and his Miniſter were intereſted in the preſervation of the Kingdom, and thought nothing was juſt, but what this imperious Prelate pretended to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that had the Courage to defend the Rights of Parliament, urged in vain, that the perſons that compoſed it, had never pretended to be their Kings Tutors, nor to arrogate a power ſuperior, or equal to theirs; nor to ſet up for <hi>Tribunes of the People,</hi> as their enemies injuriouſly accuſed them. They own'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the Kings Subjects, and to derive their power from his Authority; but then they ſaid, that a Secret of Policy lay concealed in the exerciſe of their Offices, which the Flatterers at Court were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: That the ancient Kings of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that a pure Monarchy, where all the Laws depend upon the Will of one ſingle perſon, were but of a ſhort continuance, had wiſely temper'd the form of Government, by mixing ſome appearance of an Ariſtocracy with it, and by eſtabliſhing Laws, which they themſelves were not allowed to violate, that ſo the People might with greater chearfulneſs ſubmit to their ſoveraign authority: That for this end they had voluntarily ſubmitted their own Edicts to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Parliament, that ſo they might fully be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54967:148"/>inform'd, whether they contain'd any thing contrary to the known Laws, and Rules of Equity: That their Conſcience and true Intereſt engaged them to obſerve theſe Laws impartially, and not to violate Juſtice; That nevertheleſs, in caſe they were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Parliaments did not give them good counſel, they were ſtill at liberty to have recourſe to their abſolute power, as it appeared by theſe terms in their Edicts, <hi>For ſuch is our good pleaſure:</hi> That Declarations are not addreſſed to the Parliaments out of pure formality, which was wholly unneceſſary, but that the people might afterwards obey them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any repugnance: That it had been the antient policy of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> to make all ſorts of Graces depend upon themſelves, but to ſee Juſtice adminiſtred in the Soveraign Courts: That this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Kings from the Odium that might enſue upon the exerciſe of any ſevere act of Juſtice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides diſengaged them, from the importunity of their Courtiers, who without this might lead them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſeveral injuſt things, highly prejudicial to the Welfare of their States.</p>
               <p>To return now to foreign affairs; ever ſince the beginning of the foregoing year, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had demanded a Paſsport of the King to come to Court, out of hopes he might obtain the poſſeſſion of his Dominions, by giving ſome ſatisfaction to his Majeſty; and it was at laſt<note n="*" place="margin">

T. 1. lib. 2. p. 289.</note> The Cardinal, who by his natural inclination to invade the Rights of others, without conſidering the ill conſequences that might follow, had ſeized upon the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſome years before, found by experience, that this conduct had extremely ſunk his Reputation, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> where there was not a Prince who did not with great Jealouſy and Concern look upon this aggrandizing of <hi>France,</hi> as fearing to be treated after the ſame manner as the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had been. Upon this conſideration he judged, that after he ſufficiently humbled him, it would be the beſt way
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54967:148"/>to re-eſtabliſh him, ſince he was not now in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give any umbrage to <hi>France;</hi> and that this would gain him the eſteem of ſeveral Princes, who might very eminently contribute in their reſpective ſtations, towards the depreſſing of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> About this time the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> falling paſſionately in Love with the Counteſs of <hi>Cantecroix,</hi> had a mind to be divorced from his Dutcheſs <hi>Nicole,</hi> but this is a point upon which we need enlarge no more. 'Tis ſufficient to obſerve, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Ib. p. 291.</note> Counteſs was very ſerviceable to the Cardinal, to incline the Duke to make freſh Sollicitations for the favour of <hi>France,</hi> which promiſed to procure a Divorce for him from <hi>Rome.</hi> The ill condition of his own affairs did likewiſe oblige him to it, ſince having no money to pay off the ſmall Army he kept on foot, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to allow the Soldiers to do what they pleaſed, which ſet him in ill circumſtances with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> upon whoſe Lands they had been quarter'd for a long time.</p>
               <p>At laſt, being entred into <hi>France,</hi> he ſaw the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and arrived on the 10th of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> where he was received with all imaginable reſpect. Aſſoon as he appear'd before the King, he immediately ſet one Knee upon the ground, and told him, that he came to humble himſelf before him, and ſubmit his fortune to his Majeſty's Clemency. The King offer'd thrice to raiſe him up, but he proteſted that he would not quit that poſture, till his Majeſty had forgiven him for all his paſt faults. The King was then pleaſed to aſſure him, that he had not the leaſt remembrance of what was paſt, and that he would aſſiſt him for the future. The Duke got up, and covered himſelf, after which he went to ſee the Queen, and the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> undertook this voyage, to endeavour to regain at leaſt one part of his Country, to procure ſome money for the ſubſiſtence of his Troops, and to engage the King to act at <hi>Rome</hi> in the favour of his Marriage with the Counteſs of <hi>Cante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croix.</hi> If he obtain'd the two firſt Articles, he would be able to make better conditions of agreement with
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54967:149"/>the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in caſe he deſigned to embrace their party afreſh, or if he found it advantageous to him, he might ſtill continue linked to the Intereſts of <hi>France.</hi> But what he moſt earneſtly deſired was the Confirmation of his Marriage; and he had brought the Counteſs along with him into <hi>France,</hi> if the King had not ſent him word to leave her at <hi>Eſpinal.</hi> The Cardinal had given his word to the Nuncio, that he would in no manner ſupport the Duke as to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from his Dutcheſs <hi>Nicole;</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> might not ſpeak to him about him, he ſpread a report abroad, that the King was reſolv'd to employ all his power with the Duke to prevail with him to be reconciled to his Wife. When the Duke firſt heard of this pretended deſign of the King, he was extremely mortified, for he could not endure to hear the leaſt mention of this Accommodation; ſo that any one might perceive he took it for a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to talk to him about it, much leſs to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they would lend him their aſſiſtance to break off his Marriage. Thus he contented himſelf to talk with the Nuncio concerning it, and ſince he found the King did not countenance his deſign, he did not importune the Cardinal to favour him, in a pretenſion ſo unjuſt as this really was.</p>
               <p>Not to deſcend into the conſequences of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affair, 'twill be ſufficient to obſerve, that the King concluded the Treaty, concerning the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> on the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> and ſwore to the obſervation of it the ſame day, as well as the Duke, in the Chappel of <hi>St. Germain.</hi>

Beſides this, the Duke was obliged to renounce all manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to reſign his Troops to the King, who was to entertain them as his own, and to pay the Dutcheſs <hi>Nicole</hi> ſixſcore thouſand Livres by way of penſion. The Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54967:149"/>with a promiſe which the Duke made to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Articles ſo faithfully, that beſides what he left to his Majeſty to be inſeparably re-united to the Crown, he conſented that the reſt of his Dominions ſhould devolve to the aforeſaid Crown of <hi>France,</hi> if he in the leaſt infringed this Treaty. By this Article the Cardinal put the King in a fair way to invade <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> afreſh with a great appearance of Juſtice on his ſide, if ever the Duke ſhould violate the leaſt Clauſe of this Treaty, which it was not doubted but he would ſoon do, by reaſon of his natural inconſtancy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence. In the mean time <hi>France</hi> did itſelf the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this reſtitution, and the Kings Miniſters in all places proclaim'd and boaſted of their Maſters ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was no ſooner return'd home but he began to fortifie <hi>La Mothe,</hi> an important place, which the Mareſchal <hi>de la Force</hi> had not been able to take, till after a tedious Siege of ſeveral months, as we have already obſerved. Altho this was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by any one Article of the Treaty, yet they immediately ſuſpected that he deſign'd to make a freſh rupture with <hi>France.</hi> The principal diſcontent which made him leave <hi>Paris,</hi> was becauſe the Court was ſo far from helping him to break off his Marriage, that they would not conſent that the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Counteſs of <hi>Cantecroix</hi> for their Dutcheſs. This was the reaſon why that Lady diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged him from the party of <hi>France,</hi> and prevail'd with him to joyn himſelf again to the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> which he had not quitted but by her perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon the hopes the latter had given her to act in her favour. Thus, never conſidering whether he ſhould be able to ſupport himſelf againſt <hi>France,</hi> he entered into a new Alliance with the Cardinal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta, under a pretence that the Treaty he had ſo lately made, was to his manifeſt prejudice and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. His Majeſty being informed of theſe<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 464.</note> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Duke, ſent the <hi>Count de Graunccy</hi> at the head of a ſmall Army into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and with <hi>Du Hallier,</hi> Governor of <hi>Nancy,</hi> he once more made himſelf Maſter of all the places belonging to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate

               <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> was no more exact in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Treaty he had concluded with <hi>France,</hi> towards the end of the laſt year. They were fully convinc'd of it at the beginning of this, when they ſaw that inſtead of coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> according to his his promiſe, he treated anew with <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that now 'twas viſible, that the true reaſon of his reconciling himſelf to <hi>France,</hi> was only to make a better market for himſelf with <hi>Spain.</hi> Altho he was ill ſatisfied with the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> and ſome others, yet he had no quarrel with his Catholic Majeſty; and indeed he durſt not truſt Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> whom he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in ſo many reſpects, and who had this repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation all <hi>Europe</hi> over, that he was never guilty of forgiving any one.</p>

               <p>At laſt, to oblige the <hi>French</hi> to abandon <hi>Yvree,</hi> the Prince made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reſolve to attack <hi>Chivas,</hi> which was not in a condition to make any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, having but a ſmall Garriſon there, with ſome pieces of Cannon, but no Bullets, ſo that they were forced to cover the Stones with Lead, to make them ſerve inſtead of Bullets.

               <p>The Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> daily continued to preſs <hi>Yvree,</hi> but being informed what danger <hi>Chivas</hi> was in, he reſolved to go and relieve it, thinking after that to come before <hi>Yvree,</hi> and carry on the Siege of that place. He parted by night from the 14th to the 15th of <hi>May,</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> no ſooner heard the News of his March, but they concluded to retire on the other ſide the <hi>Po,</hi> under a pretence that now the Siege of <hi>Yvree</hi> was raiſed, they had fully executed their deſign. It was not poſſible for Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> with all the Arguments he could uſe, to ſtop the fearful <hi>Sirvela</hi> for never ſo ſhort a time; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> ſaw the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other ſide the <hi>Po.</hi> aſſoon as they arrived here.

               <p>But tho the <hi>French</hi> Army retired from before <hi>Yvree,</hi> yet they did not ceaſe from farther action.

The night following the <hi>Spaniards</hi> got a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Faſcines, to fill up the <hi>French</hi> Retrenchments, and a boggy place, over which they deſign'd to enter the City.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54967:153"/>to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> longer time to relieve this place, the <hi>French</hi> Generals granted them very honourable conditions. The Garriſon marched out the next day, with Drums beating, Colours flying, Match lighted, Ball in Mouth, in ſhort with all the other Marks of Honour which are uſually granted to thoſe that have defended themſelves well, and yet don't ſtay till the laſt extremity before they ſurrender.</p>
               <p>The ſame day that the Garriſon of <hi>Aire</hi> marched out, that of <hi>Genap</hi> capitulated, after a Siege of about a months continuance. The King had renewed this year, the antient Treaties he had made with the States General, and had promiſed to ſend them twelve hundred thouſand Livres, upon condition they would attempt ſome conſiderable enterprize. In purſuance of this Treaty, <hi>Frederic Henry</hi> attacqu'd <hi>Genap,</hi> and after he had made himſelf Maſter of the Town, reduced the Caſtle to capitulate at the time abovementioned.</p>
               <p>The taking of <hi>Aire</hi> did ſo wonderfully provoke the Cardinal Infanta, by reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the lamentable conſequences this Conqueſt might draw after it, for the reſt of <hi>Artois</hi> and for <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he reſolv'd to diſlodge the Army of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raye,</hi> and attempt the Siege of this place,<note n="*" place="margin">Siri lb. p 465.</note> before they could furniſh it with neceſſary proviſions. So <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boi</hi> having join'd him with four thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe, the day after the reduction of the place, he adventur'd to beſiege the victorious Army, and to hinder them from receiving victuals or other relief, he made a Detachment out of his Army, under the command of the Count <hi>de Salaſar,</hi> who took <hi>Lillers,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Ecluſe</hi> between <hi>Doway</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> and defeated a Convoy which advanced to throw themſelves into this latter Fort. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made ſome new Forts between <hi>Terwen</hi> and <hi>St. Omers,</hi> to hinder any proviſions from coming that way.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of <hi>Anguſt</hi> the Cardinal Infanta marched directly towards the Lines of the <hi>French,</hi> whom he kept in breath with continual skirmiſhes, but was not able to bring them to a battel, till at laſt the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> fearing that if he ſtay'd in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54967:153"/>this Poſt much longer, ſcarcity of Proviſions and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition would deſtroy his Army, as well as the place he had ſo lately taken, retired by night on the 9th of the ſame month, and marched in all haſte to poſſeſs himſelf of the Paſs of <hi>Terwin,</hi> leſt the Enemy ſhould prevent him. Before he parted, he repair'd the Breaches as well as he could, and fill'd up the greateſt part of the Lines. He put three thouſand men into the place, and gave the Government of it to <hi>Aigueberre,</hi> with food enough for two or three months, if rightly managed. He could not leave them any more Powder, which was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them, but he hoped to throw a Convoy ſhortly into the place.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the Mareſchal was diſlodged, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Infanta enter'd his Lines, and began the Siege of this place, with a great deal of vigour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but ſo as not to expoſe his men too much to the Enemy's ſhot. As he knew it was not provided with every thing neceſſary, he hoped ſoon to reduce the Garriſon by Famine. The Mareſchal did what he could to throw ſome proviſions into it, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſo ſtrongly upon their guard, that all thoſe that endeavor'd it were beaten back with loſs. By the 20th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rais'd three Batteries, the beſieged not thinking it worth the while to incommode them by their Cannon, becauſe they had not Powder enough, and were oblig'd to reſerve the little they had till a time of neceſſity. Soon after the Garriſon diſarm'd the Burghers, and turn'd all unproſitable Mouths out of the place. However, to oblige the Cardinal Infanta to abandon his deſign, the Mareſchal <hi>de Breze</hi> attacked <hi>Lens,</hi> which he took, and <hi>Meilleraye</hi> took <hi>la Baſſee</hi> likewiſe, and made inroads into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they burnt and ravaged ten or twelve leagues round the Country. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtill carried on the Siege which they had begun, hoping the place would ſhortly fall into their hands, through want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

               <p>But upon advice, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had weaken'd all their Garriſons, to form a ſmall body of men, in order to hinder the excurſions they made into their Country, the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> attempted the Siege of <hi>Bapaume,</hi> a place of great importance, and difficult to be beſieged, by reaſon of the great ſcarcity of Water. He began to beſiege it in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and took it by Capitulation on the 18th of the ſame month. The Garriſon was to be conducted, according to the Capitulation, as far as <hi>Doway;</hi> but not being able to compaſs it in one day, they paſs'd the night at <hi>Ecluſe,</hi> and purſued their way the next morning.

                  </note> he fell upon them, kill'd part of their men, and pillag'd the whole Baggage.

Thoſe of <hi>Barcelona</hi> worked night and day upon their Fortifications, to put that place in a condition of defending it ſelf, and no perſons were exempted from ſo neceſſary a duty.

               <p>
                  <hi>Serignan</hi> enter'd into <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and conducted ſome of the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Troops thither, altho he was purſued by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry. The Marquis <hi>de loz Velez,</hi> being within a few leagues of this City, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a Trumpeter to them, with Letters to the <hi>Deputation</hi> of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The Viceroy promis'd to employ all his intereſt with the King, to procure them a full Indemnity for their Inſurrection, upon condition they would diſengage themſelves from <hi>France;</hi> and on the other hand he threatned them with very rigorous puniſhments, if they perſiſted longer in their obſtinacy. The <hi>Catalonians</hi> after they had amus'd the Trumpet as long as they could, in

               <p>On the 26th of <hi>January</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army advanced to attack <hi>Montjui,</hi> which is within half a league of <hi>Barcelona;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Catalonian</hi> Cavalry, to the number of five hundred, marched out of the City to obſerve the Countenance of the Enemy.

Altho the Cannon of the City began to incommode them, yet they ſtill advanced forward, even within Muſquet ſhot, and bravely attack'd the <hi>French</hi> Cavalry with Swords in their hands; but the Duke being mortally wounded, and ſeveral Officers of Note killed, thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him were obliged to retreat, leaving a hundred and fifty dead upon the ſpot, and a great number of wounded.

This Hill being acceſſible on every ſide, except by the Sea, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army began ſoon after to mount it, and the Forlorn Hope eaſily gain'd the advance Poſts, which the <hi>Catalonians</hi> were ordered to keep, who fled almoſt aſſoon as the Enemy appear'd.

               </p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> having receiv'd this news, was in doubt whether it would be for the advantage of <hi>France,</hi> to accept of this Donation of <hi>Catalonia</hi> or no, by reaſon of the great obſtruction this would bring to the concluding of a Peace, and the mighty Expence the King would be oblig'd to be at for the preſerving of this Country.

                  </gap>, without engaging too far in its defence. But being convinc'd at laſt, that the <hi>Catalonians</hi> would never be able to govern themſelves long in the form of a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54967:156"/>Commonwealth, but would infallibly fall again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government; and laſtly conſidering, that it would be ſcandalous for the King to refuſe ſo important a Donation, only for fear of engaging himſelf in ſome expence, he believed he was obliged to accept of it. <hi>Bezancon</hi> was ſurprized at this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in the Cardinal, being fully of opinion, that if they had not neglected matters ſo at firſt, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately imployed ſufficient Forces in that Province, the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of both which places had a mighty kindneſs for the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> would have fallen after the ſame manner, into the hands of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after the defeat of <hi>Montjui,</hi> retreated to their firſt Camp of <hi>Tarragone,</hi> and the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> encouraged by this Victory, put themſelves in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to preſerve the advantage they had gain'd. The King gave Orders to the Marquis <hi>de Breze,</hi> who commanded a ſmall Fleet in the Ocean, to ſail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> to hinder them from ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Fleet upon the Coaſts of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> He met, near <hi>Cales,</hi> with a Fleet bound for <hi>America,</hi> of which he ſunk or burnt five Gallions, whereof the Admiral was one, and the reſt he put to flight.

               <p>In the mean time, as the Forces that were ſent by Land into <hi>Catalonia</hi> run great dangers, ſo long as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Maſters of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> and it would be a difficult matter to preſerve <hi>Catalonia,</hi> unleſs they were poſſeſt of that County,<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer: T. 1. l. 2. p. 434.</note> the Court of <hi>France</hi> now began to think of ſeizing it, if it were poſſible this year. <hi>The Marquis de Mortare</hi> was Governour of it, and had a ſmall Body of five thouſand Foot, and thirteen hundred Horſe.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54967:157"/>the Caſtle in a few days. The inhabitants of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geles,</hi> a place of great importance, becauſe it could cut off from <hi>Rouſillon</hi> all manner of communication with the port of <hi>Roſes,</hi> turn'd out the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon, and open'd their Gates to the <hi>French.</hi> Soon after the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Peaſants, who extremly incommoded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with their excurſions, carried off a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Convoy, which was going from <hi>Collioure</hi> to <hi>Perpignan;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> took <hi>Elne,</hi> which lyes between <hi>Perpignan</hi> and <hi>Collioure,</hi> on the 27th of <hi>June,</hi> altho it was very well defended by ſome <hi>Italian</hi> Troops that were in the place.</p>
               <p>After this the Prince divided his Army into two Bodies, one of which was ſent to <hi>La Mothe</hi> near <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragone,</hi> and the other deſign'd to overrun <hi>Rouſillon.

               <p>On the 9th of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having form'd a deſign to ſeize a poſt near the Sea, from whence they expected relief, and at the ſame time to favour a Convoy of ſorrage which was to come to them, put two or three thouſand men out of their Lines, to put his project in execution.

The reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army which had advanced out of their Lines, to favour the retreat of thoſe who firſt went out, was in like manner defeated, after a ſharp reſiſtance. 'Tis ſaid that in this rancounter the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſt ſix hundred men, and the <hi>French</hi> an hundred.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army having got into their Lines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or into the City, began now to feel the terrible effects of a violent Famine, and the Prince <hi>de Bottero</hi> who commanded it, caus'd to be diſtributed daily to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54967:157"/>each Soldier two ounces of Rice, and three of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh; for they made no difficulty to kill their Horſes, becauſe they wanted forrage for them. In the mean time care was taken at <hi>Madrid</hi> to raiſe a ſmall body of men, to go and deliver the Army that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged at <hi>Tarragone,</hi> and aſſoon as they had got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſix thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe, the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> receiv'd orders to place himſelf at the head of them, and endeavour to force the <hi>French</hi> Lines. The Marquis ſet forward with this deſign, but as he was not become more dexterous in military matters in <hi>Spain</hi> than he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> he thought that the Paſſes were ſo well guarded, that it would be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour loſt to attack him. Thus he retreated peaceably within ſome leagues of the place, without adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to do any thing for its relief.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>de Bottero</hi>'s Army being now reduced to the laſt extremity, were exceeding joyful to ſee a<note n="*" place="margin">On the <hi>4</hi> h of <hi>July;</hi>
                  </note> Fleet of forty Gallies appear, but the difficulty was, how to make their way into the Harbour thro the <hi>French</hi> Veſſels. However the Prince of <hi>Ferrandine,</hi> who commanded this Fleet, was fully reſolved to attempt it, ſince it was not poſſible to ſave the Town and Army otherwiſe. Having therefore obſerv'd, that the Squadron of the Admiral and Vice Admiral lay at ſome diſtance from one another, he determin'd to paſs through their two firings; but there were only ten Gallies that durſt follow him through all the Cannon and Muſquet ſhot of the Enemy. They loſt abundance of men, and were extremely ſhattered before they could reach the Mole; and as they were unloading the Proviſions they brought upon the Key, the Squadron of the Admiral coming near, began to cannonade them ſo furiouſly, that they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity return the ſame way they came to avoid being ſunk. However they performed it, and the <hi>French</hi> out of one and forty Gallies only took one; they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded but a ſmall quantity of proviſions, and landed ſome men on Shore; in a few weeks both the Army and Town were in a worſe condition than before, and began to feed upon Dogs, Rats, and Cats. Thus this Attempt of the Fleet only ſerv'd to deſtroy four or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54967:158"/>five hundred men in paſſing through, and to put a great number of Gallies out of a condition to appear for a long time at Sea.</p>
               <p>But not to abandon a Town and an Army, which combated with much more reſolution againſt Famine than againſt the Enemy, <hi>Spain</hi> made its laſt effort, and ſet to Sea a Fleet of ſixty Sail, followed by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Brigandines laden with proviſions. It<note n="*" place="margin">

The Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> who had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſucceeded by meer hazard, was in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation that he was uncapable of making head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Enemy, ſo that after the loſt of three Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, he eſcaped with the reſt of his Fleet very much damaged, to <hi>Provence.</hi> Notwithſtanding this defeat, <hi>La Mothe</hi> ſtaid ſome days longer in his Lines, but fearing the ſuccours which continually arrived at <hi>Tarragone,</hi> he retook the poſts, where he was lodg'd before, between <hi>Conſtantin</hi> and <hi>Valz,</hi> and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned this deſign.</p>
               <p>They were much diſſatisfied with the Archbiſhops conduct at Court, becauſe he had ſent them word that he was ſtrong enough to beat any <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet that ſhould come before him, and then after he had abandoned the Sea to the Enemy, would have made them believe that he had got the Victory. 'Tis reported that this man had gain'd the Cardinal's favour, by applying himſelf intirely to him, without making his Court to any of his Relations, or Creatures. He had been Steward of the Cardinal's Houſe, and made the Servants and Tenants give an account of every thing, with ſo much rigour, that the Cardinal won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his exactneſs, beſides that the Archbiſhop put in frequently ſomething of his own, which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly increaſed the Cardinal's revenues. But as all the World hated him, and eſpecially <hi>De Noyers</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, no means were left unattempted to deſtroy him. 'Tis ſaid that it was with this proſpect he was
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54967:158"/>ſent into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> with a Fleet which they knew was not in a condition to oppoſe that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that it was againſt his advice that <hi>La Mothe</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtarve <hi>Tarragone.</hi> As ſoon as he was arriv'd at <hi>Toulon,</hi> the Officers mutinied againſt him, and refuſed to own him for their Admiral. They likewiſe ſent relations to Court quite different from his, and accuſed him of being poſitive and humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and that he never regarded the advice of thoſe perſons, who had the greateſt experience in Sea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. As all the Court in general joyn'd with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, the King and Cardinal immediately concurr'd in an ill opinion of him, and at laſt reſolved to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the informations againſt this Prelate to be taken. In the mean time they took from him the command the Fleet; which was none of the fitteſt poſts for a Biſhop, and baniſhed him to <hi>Carpentras.</hi> At the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, altho he was certainly in the wrong to take up a profeſſion which he did not underſtand, and his conduct was far from being regular, yet the Cardinal, who pretended to know the men whom he employ'd, was more to be blamed, for giving to a Biſhop, and to a perſon ſo uncapable as he was, a Fleet to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54967:159"/>13th of that Month took poſſeſſion of it. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> complained of this hard uſage to all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> but eſpecially to the Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> and to the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who promiſed to act in his behalf, but had done much better if they had hindered the <hi>Barberini</hi> from ſtripping him of part of his territory, by ſending ſufficient forces to this Prince, when he firſt demanded them; ſince 'tis infinitely eaſier to prevent a miſchief of this nature, than to apply Remedies to it when 'tis once done. The beſt ſupport which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> found upon this occaſion, was the Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtrees,</hi> a great Enemy to the <hi>Barberini,</hi> who being recalled from his embaſſy at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtopt at <hi>Parma,</hi> and offered his ſervice to the Duke, as we ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had received this hard Treatment, the Pope fulminated an Admonition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, by which he ordered him to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> under pain of Excommunication.

               <p>To return now to the Affairs of the Cardinal: The Queen Mother, who had reſided for ſome time at <hi>London,</hi> was obliged to depart out of <hi>England,</hi> at the private inſtances he made to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. This Prince being unluckily embroil'd with his own people, was not in a condition to refuſe any thing to <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. leſt he ſhould foment theſe diſorders, more than he had already done; ſo that he gave his Mother-in-law to underſtand, that ſhe would extremely oblige him, if ſhe would leave <hi>England.</hi> She deſir'd to return into the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> but whatever ſollicitations his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> could make in her behalf, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who were diſſatisfied with her former conduct, would not ſo much as give her leave to paſs through their Country, Nor durſt the States of the <hi>

               <p>The Cardinal, who was pleaſed at theſe mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which this unhappy Princeſs received, was not ſorry to ſee her intirely abandon'd by her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and her Sons-in law.

The Miniſter did not drop his pretenſions for all that, but flatter'd himſelf that by ill uſing and diſregarding the Count, he ſhould at laſt break his haughty Spirit: As he believed that the King would never have any Children, he imagined that the Heirs of the Count and his Neice, might one day ſit upon the Throne: And he thought that by pretending to ſerve the Count, who was a high ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but imprudent Prince, he ſhould humble the D. of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> but the inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtancy of the Count defeated all his projects, which appeared to be ſo much the more Chimerical, after the King had Sons to ſucceed him. Whatever he pretended in public, 'tis certain that the Cardinal had an unconquerable averſion to the Count, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that twas impoſſible to commit ſmall faults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, contempt was the thing in the world that moſt diſguſted him, and which he took care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in the ſevereſt manner. To this we may add, that the Cabals of the Count, which oppoſed the grandeur of the Miniſter, rais'd his hatred to the higheſt extremity, and it received no diminution by the retirement of the Count to <hi>Sedan,</hi> who had engaged the King to pay the Garriſon of that City, purſuant to the Treaty, againſt the opinion of the Cardinal, who had adviſed that this Money ſhould be paid to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> 'Tis reported, that his deſign was to oblige that Prince to ſell that place to him, for which he had offer'd him in vain great ſumms of Money, and Lands in another place. Nay, ſome perſons confidently affirm, that the Miniſter had a mind to erect a ſmall Soveraignty for himſelf upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> to retreat thither in caſe of neceſſity. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, 'tis certain he loved the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> at the bottom no more than he did the Count of <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> Beſides, he was diſguſted with the<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54967:162"/>whereby they promis'd never to ſeparate their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; ſo that he hop'd to ruin them both at one blow, by attacking <hi>Sedan.</hi> He ſent word to the D. of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that the King having received advice that the Count and the D. of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had entered into a Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> it would be his beſt way to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf from that faction, and come and beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his fault; that if the Duke fell into this ſnare, his confeſſion might ſerve to condemn the other two.</p>
               <p>Not long after, the Cardinal ſaid publickly, that the King had certain proofs that the Princes had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Treaty with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the means of the Abbot <hi>de Mercy,</hi> and laſtly by Don <hi>Michael de Salamanca,</hi> Secretary to the Cardinal Infanta, with whom the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had perſonally conferr'd near <hi>Sedan.</hi> The Counteſs of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> being inform'd of what the Miniſter had thus affirm'd, went to ſee him with the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> to endeavour to juſtifie her Son, and to obtain for him a prolongation of the permiſſion he had to reſide at <hi>Sedan.</hi> The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal return'd no poſitive anſwer to the Counteſs's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, under a pretence of conſulting his Majeſty before-hand, but ſome days after, ſending for the Duke and Dutcheſs, he told them, <q>That the King and he were willing to believe that the Count was not guilty, altho they knew that the Duke of <hi>Bouil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> had treated with Don <hi>Michael de Salamanca,</hi> upon the frontiers of the Principality of <hi>Sedan;</hi> and that it was hardly to be imagined that the Count, who had ſo particular a friendſhip for the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> knew nothing of the matter: That if it were true, that he was wholly ignorant of it, he ought to leave <hi>Sedan,</hi> and diſengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Duke's Intereſts: That he might go to <hi>Venice</hi> or to <hi>Neufchatel,</hi> or to any of his Country houſes: That it was extremely ſcandalous for a Prince of his Birth, to live united with the enemies of the Kingdom, where his deſcendants might one day ſit upon the Throne; that, in fine, it was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for him to be innocent, but that he ought to be exempt from all ſuſpicion. The Counteſs excuſed her Son as far as ſhe might, and complain'd that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54967:163"/>bare ſuſpicions they had ſuſpended him from the exerciſe of his Office of Grand Maſter of the Kings Houſe, and ſtopt his Penſions:</q> But all ſhe could draw from the Cardinal was, <q>That if the Count was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he ought to quit <hi>Sedan;</hi> and if he was guilty, both he and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> ought to confeſs their fault, and they ſhould be pardoned: That he would do well to reſolve with all ſpeed to do one of theſe two things, becauſe his Majeſty would no longer be uncertain of his fidelity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the Count's friends adviſed him to retire from <hi>Sedan,</hi> and give way to the Miniſters indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would otherwiſe deſtroy him; but he could not endure to hear any talk of it, and continued firm in his reſolution to run the ſame fortune with the Dukes of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Guiſe.</hi> As none of theſe three were in the humour to rely upon the Cardinals good nature, they at laſt concluded their Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> to furniſh them with ſufficient Forces. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe raiſed others in the Country of <hi>Leige,</hi> and hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities began on both ſides, by plundering and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every thing that enter'd the Principality of <hi>Sedan</hi> or <hi>Champagne,</hi> ever ſince the beginning of <hi>April.</hi> The Cardinal ordered ſome Troops to advance on that ſide, under the Marquis <hi>de Sourdis,</hi> till the Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> could put himſelf at the head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which was deſigned to act againſt them.</p>
               <p>At this time the Princeſs <hi>Ann de Gonzaga,</hi> whom the King had forbidden to remove out of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> paſs'd into <hi>Champagne,</hi> with a deſign to reſide in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> near her Lover: But the Vicount <hi>de Tavanes,</hi> who commanded ſome Troops in that Province, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of it, cauſed her to be ſtopt till ſuch time as he receiv'd an Order from Court what to do. The Courier whom he ſent, brought him word, that he was not only to ſuffer this Princeſs to paſs on in her journey, but likewiſe to furniſh her with as many Coaches and Horſes as ſhe might have occaſion for. It was believed that ſhe would only help to perplex the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>'s affairs; but the principal reaſon why they ſuffer'd her to paſs on, was becauſe the Cardinal deſir'd that the Duke might marry her out
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:54967:163"/>of hand, that ſo his Benefices might come to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, theſe Princes order'd their men to work night and day upon the For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ifications of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> and made Magazines of all things neceſſary to make a vigorous reſiſtance, in caſe they were attackt.

                  </gap>y had done any thing, and by ill uſing them, began new to fear in his turn, that he had embarked in a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affair. If they beſieg'd <hi>Sedan,</hi> they might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to come off with the worſt, this place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tackt, it was to be feared, that as ſoon as theſe Princes had an Army, they would make excurſions into the heart of the Kingdom. In caſe they gain'd any advantages at firſt, it was reaſonable to apprehend that vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people would flock to them, and ſo their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty become very formidable.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations made the Cardinal appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely irreſolute and full of diſtruſt. Sometimes he talked of giving no quarter to the Kings Enemies, but entirely deſtroying them; at other times he ſeem'd not unwilling to enter into ſome compoſition, and ſeem'd to repent that he had provok'd ſo many people to deſpair, who were really in a better caſe to make themſelves be fear'd, than he at firſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd. Thus when the Ambaſſador of the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſpoke to the Cardinal of the Mediation of his Maſters to accommodate this affair, by reaſon of the intereſt which the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had in the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s preſervation, he was at firſt liſtned to by the Miniſter with great attention.</p>
               <p>Another thing happen'd at this time, which gave him a great deal of diſturbance. He learnt of the King, that <hi>Bullion,</hi> the Superintendant of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, had told him that all the Money for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and the Artillery was ſpent: (The Cardinal was Intendant of the Marine, and his Couſin, the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Artillery) That the Cardinal was the Author of this War, and only kept it up for his private ends: That he knew
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54967:164"/>not where to find any more Money to ſupport it; but that if he would be pleaſed to grant a few years Peace to his Kingdom, he would take care to lay up ſuch conſiderable ſumms, that they ſhould be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to carry on any deſign whatever, in which his Majeſty had a mind to engage himſelf. At laſt, <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> begg'd of his Majeſty not to ſpeak a ſyllable of this to his Eminence, becauſe if he came to know of it, he would never ſuffer him to dye in his Bed. The King gave him his promiſe, and believing what he told him was true, kept his word with him, and ſaid nothing of it to the Cardinal till the Superintendant was dead. The haughty Miniſter anſwer'd the King, <hi>That he was ſorry his Majeſty cited a dead Witneſs;</hi> and the King replyed, That he had forborn to ſpeak of it while <hi>Bullion</hi> was alive, becauſe the latter told him, that if the Cardinal knew of it he ſhould certainly be deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p>The Negotiation of the Ambaſſador of the States came to nothing, not from the Cardinal's being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, but becauſe the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> rejected the propoſitions which the Ambaſſador made. Whether he was of opinion, that it was to no purpoſe to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile himſelf to a man, whoſe hatred was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd but only in appearance, or whether his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity kept him from making any ſubmiſſions to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, as it was propoſed to him, he reſolved to ſee whether he might not gain ſome advantage by force of arms, before he made an Accommodation.<note n="*" place="margin">See an Abridgm. of the Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne of <hi>1641.</hi> in <hi>Aubery</hi>'s <hi>Mem.

                  </note> The Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> went to put himſelf at the head of the Army of <hi>Champagne</hi> in <hi>May,</hi> and the King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as far as <hi>Abbeville,</hi> to be nearer <hi>Artois,</hi> where he deſign'd to beſiege <hi>Aire,</hi> as we have already taken notice.

                  </note> wherein, after he had obſerv'd that the Princes who were at <hi>Sedan,</hi> had committed ſeveral hoſtilities and joyned themſelves to <hi>Spain,</hi> he order'd all his Subjects to take them for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Enemies, if they did not within a month ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their fault, and ſubmit themſelves to his Majeſty's Clemency.</p>

               <p>In anſwer to this Declaration, the Princes made a long Manifeſto dated the 2d of <hi>July,</hi> but it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in public till after the Battel of <hi>Sedan,</hi> which put an end to this Affair.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſaid that his Conſcience obliged him to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ill deſigns of the Cardinal, which he had ſo long forborn to do, that his Majeſty might have the entire Glory of chaſtiſing this imperious Miniſter, who had aſſumed upon him the Royal authority, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, <q>That it was four years ſince he had been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to retire to <hi>Sedan,</hi> to live there in ſecurity, and that he had refuſed to go any where elſe, that he might not give the Cardinal an opportunity to accuſe him of being an Enemy to <hi>France:</hi> That nevertheleſs the Cardinal had ſought all imaginable means to deſtroy him, and to make himſelf maſter of <hi>Sedan,</hi> altho the D. of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had not done any thing which ought to deprive him of his Majeſty's protection: That no ways had been left unattempted to acquaint the King with the ill conduct of his Miniſter, but that this had produced no other effect, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and ruin of thoſe perſons who had done it: That conſequently there was a neceſſity to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the noiſe of arms, that equity and reaſon might be heard: That after ſeveral deliberations, in concert with the Dukes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Princes, and Officers of the Crown, he declared the Cardinal to be the greateſt and moſt dangerous Enemy of the King and State: That he had made himſelf maſter of the ſtrongeſt places of the Kingdom, and ſeized the Mouths of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Rivers, Ports, and Iſlands in the Ocean, and in general all the ſecurities of <hi>France:</hi> That to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf in this Uſurpation, he ruin'd the reſt of the Kingdom by War, to put the people out of a condition to recover what he had uſurped: That he deſigned to deliver the King into the hands of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54967:165"/>thoſe to whom he was allied (<hi>he means the Duke of</hi> Enguien, <hi>who had lately married one of his Nieces</hi>) and that he endeavour'd to approach the Crown, altho it was the intereſt of <hi>France</hi> to keep him at a diſtance from it: That if he could not accompliſh this deſign, he was in a condition to give his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Keys of the Realm, to open and ſhut the gates of Traffick, and ſtarve the great Cities when they pleaſed: That the King and Monſieur perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it well enough, but durſt not ſpeak of it, and that the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> affirmed it in the name of the whole Royal Family: That this deſign of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appear'd, in that he had made the beſt years of the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> barren: That there was reaſon to fear that he deſign'd to ſecure himſelf from the power of his Majeſty's Juſtice, that ſo he might not give an account of his unjuſt miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Finances, and the ſuppreſſion of ſo many innocent people: That he had raſhly engaged the reputation of the King, diſſipated his Treaſures, prodigally thrown away the Blood of the Nobility and Souldiers, and reduced the people to the laſt miſery, to ſatisfy his paſſions, and carry on his own particular quarrels: That the only reaſon why he had declar'd the War, was to ſupport his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which he thought he ſhould never be able to preſerve but in times of trouble: That he had rendred all thoſe whom he deſign'd to deſtroy, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of High Treaſon, in order to turn them out of their places, which he either took into his own hands, or conferr'd upon thoſe that promiſed to maintain him in his Tyranny: That he had ruin'd the beſt Families in the Kingdom, to raiſe his own, and had reduced ſeveral good Houſes to miſery to inrich perſons of no merit, birth, and fortune: That he drained <hi>France</hi> of its Money, to ſend it in <hi>ſpecie</hi> to foreign Countries, and fill'd the Kingdom with Money of a baſe allay: That he had bought at too exceſſive rates, both of the <hi>Swedes</hi> and others, places which he was not able to keep, as <hi>Philipsburg;</hi> or muſt, when a Peace comes, ſurrender without reimburſement, as <hi>Briſac</hi> and others: That he had
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54967:165"/>indiſcreetly ſquander'd away the Finances in <hi>Italy</hi> to acquire himſelf friends, whom he afterwards ruin'd; and thus render'd the protection which his Majeſty had given to the Dukes of <hi>Mantua, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> contemptible, and of no effect: That he had made ſome attempts in <hi>Spain,</hi> which only tended to the diſhonour of <hi>France,</hi> and gain'd ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> which were a charge to the State, and only proper to render the War everlaſting: That he had burthen'd the Kingdom with an infinite number of Officers, and dryed up the ordinary ſources of the Finances, by ſelling, or engaging the Demeans and Aids to ſo high a price, that a man could not make up his Money again, without committing a great deal of injuſtice: That he had forced ſeveral Orders to elect him for their General, as the <hi>Ciſtercians,</hi> the <hi>Clarevallenſes,</hi> and the <hi>Praemonſtratenſes;</hi> by impriſoning abundance of the Religious, who would not give him their Votes: That as for the other Orders, he had engag'd them by a thouſand artifices to elect Vicar Generals in <hi>France,</hi> that they might have no more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he might make himſelf Head of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church for Spirituals as well as Temporals: That the King had no Allies that could aſſiſt him, as being all a charge to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and only able to make feeble diverſions at the expence of <hi>France:</hi> That thoſe whom the Cardinal thought capable to oppoſe his arbritary proceeding, had been delivered into the hands of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after they had been condemned by wicked, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Commiſſioners of his own nomination, or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Priſon, or were baniſh'd the Court: That he with inhuman ingratitude had turn'd out the Queen Mother, and treated all the Princes and Noblemen of the Kingdom in a moſt arrogant manner: That he had violated or annihilated all the Laws, and all the Ordinances of the Kingdom, under the ſpecious pretence of the abſolute will and authority of the King: That he had robbed the Provinces, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of their ancient Franchiſes, and vacated the contracts they had made with former Kings:
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54967:166"/>That he had groſly abuſed the Princes, Dukes, Peers, Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> and other Officers of the Crown: That he had cauſed ſeveral innocent Noblemen to be Condemned by Commiſſioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon himſelf, and impriſon'd them without any form of proceſs: That ſome Biſhops had been judg'd contrary to the known Laws of the Land, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eccleſiaſties depriv'd of their Benefices, and all of them obliged, beſides the ordinary tenths, to pay prodigious ſums, and more than one third of their revenue, to maintain a company of Pyrates at Sea that were commanded by an Archbiſhop; and by Land, an Army of ſacrilegious Ruffians that pillag'd Churches, and were ſet on by a Cardinal: That he had treated in a moſt extreme ill manner the two Archbiſhops, Preſidents of the laſt Aſſembly of the Clergy, for repreſenting to him the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Eccleſiaſtics of <hi>France,</hi> who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven five millions and a half, above the ordinary Tenths. That ſeveral Noblemen had been ſeverely fined, forced to the <hi>Arriere-ban,</hi> and deprived of their employments, meerly becauſe they were not of his Faction.

But the Enemies having paſſed the River, within a quarter of a league of his Camp, before the Mareſchal's Guards perceiv'd it; as he marched the next day towards the River, expecting the Enemy might attempt to paſs it, he found to his ſurpize that their Army marched towards him, near the Wood of <hi>Marfee.</hi> He immediately put himſelf in Battel array in very good order, while the Enemy did the ſame, in a place too narrow, and much leſs advantageous, ſo that in all probability they would be beaten. The Mareſchal's Right Wing began the Battel with ſome advantage, but the Cavalry of the Left Wing, poſſeſt by I know not what ſort of a pannic fear, turn'd back upon their own Foot, whom they put into diſorder; ſo that the Royal Infantry being attackt by the Princes, was broken after ſome reſiſtance, and fled with the Horſe, which it was impoſſible to perſwade to rally again. This movement carried away the Right Wing, and the Mareſchal was oblig'd to retreat as the reſt had done. Whilſt the other part of the Army fled in this manner, the Regiment of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> and two Companies of Horſe of the Queen Mother, with that of Monſieur, who were in a manner the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Troops that did any ſervice, pierced to the very place where the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> was. This Prince ſeeing his men give way, marched directly to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to ſuſtain the ſhock; and as he expos'd himſelf like a common Souldier, he was wounded with a Piſtol-ſhot in his Face, which penetrated his Head, ſo he fell down dead at his Horſe's feet. Some ſay it
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54967:167"/>was a Souldier belonging to the Company of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, who ſhot him without knowing him; others, that it was one of the Count's own Guards. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, theſe three Companies of Horſe, that had the bravery to combat a victorious Enemy, were intirely cut in pieces. The Royal Army loſt five hundred men, the reſt eſcaping with that haſte into the neighbouring Woods, that the Enemy could not follow them. Nevertheleſs there were two thouſand taken Priſoners, and among them ſeveral Officers of note. The Malecontents did alſo gain the Cannon, all the Baggage, and loſt but very few men. But the death of the Count <hi>de Soiſſons,</hi> which diſpirited the whole party, was infinitely more fatal to them, than the victory was advantageous. The Mareſchal <hi>de Chatillon</hi> retir'd to <hi>Rethel,</hi> where he ſtayed to pick up the remainder of his Army, and the Mareſchal <hi>de Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze,</hi> to whom he was by no means well affected, was<note n="*" place="margin">

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho Count <hi>Maſſerati,</hi> Agent to Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> very plainly diſcover'd the groſs falſity of theſe accounts, yet the Count-Duke prepoſſeſt in <hi>Sirvela</hi>'s behalf, would not liſten to him. The Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received this news from <hi>Madrid,</hi> thought now of accommodating themſelves in good earneſt with <hi>France,</hi> and to do it the more handſomely, they ſent to acquaint the Count <hi>de Sirvela,</hi> that the King of <hi>France</hi> was ready to ſurrender all the places he held in <hi>Piedmont</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> provided the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> would do the ſame on their ſide. The Count made anſwer, that he had no power to treat about an affair of that conſequence; which gave the Princes a

               <p>Several Negotiations paſſed upon this, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difficulties between the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Count, but at laſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not giving them that ſatisfaction they demanded, they made their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation with <hi>France,</hi> and with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which was concluded at <hi>Turin</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 615.</note> on the 14th of <hi>June.</hi> To effect it with more ſecurity, they caus'd a report to be ſpread before hand, that the <hi>French</hi> went to beſiege <hi>Trino</hi> in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and pray'd <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vela</hi> to ſend ſome men thither with all poſſible ſpeed. The Count ſuffering himſelf to be intrapt, drew out the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were in <hi>Yvrce,</hi> to march that way, but afterwards Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> would not let them come in again. The Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> likewiſe turn'd <hi>Tuttavilla,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, out of <hi>Nice,</hi> making him embark by himſelf, without ſuffering him to ſpeak to any one, in a Brigandine, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that they had received advice that he deſign'd to ſurprize the Caſtle of <hi>Villa Franca.</hi> After this it was no difficult matter to turn out the Troops that were deſtitute of their Leader, ſo that the Cardinal found himſelf in a condition to conclude with <hi>France</hi> and his Siſter-in-Law, without running any hazard.

               <p>A few days after the taking of <hi>Lens,</hi> D. <hi>Franciſco de Mello</hi> went to lay Siege to <hi>Baſſee,</hi> a ſmall place, well fortified by the <hi>French</hi> ſince it was in their hands. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General needed not many Pioneers to work on the Circumvallation, becauſe it was cover'd by the River <hi>Lis,</hi> and ſeveral Canals into which the Country is cut, except on one ſide for the compaſs of a league, where he made his Retrenchments ſo ſtrong, that it was impoſſible to force them. The <hi>French</hi> ſent fifteen thouſand men to obſerve them, but durſt not attack them; and altho the Siege went on ſlowly, by reaſon of the brave reſiſtance of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nevertheleſs the <hi>Spaniards</hi> carried the Outworks by little and little; ſo that <hi>Bourdonne,</hi> Governor of the place, having no hopes to be relieved, ſurrendred it on the 13th of <hi>May,</hi> upon very honourable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Garriſon, which had been at the beginning three thouſand ſtrong, had not then above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred, ſeveral of which were ſick or wounded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army ſtay'd within their Lines till the 24th of <hi>May,</hi> [after] which they ſeparated in two bodies, to oblige the <hi>French,</hi> who were weaker than

Whether D. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco de Mello</hi> was inform'd of it or no, he march'd directly to him with the greateſt part of his Forces.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 26 <hi>of</hi> May.</note> While they attackt the Retrenchments on one ſide, on the other they entred the Wood, by diſlodging ſome of the <hi>French</hi> that were there, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Battel between the Wood and the Camp.

               <p>The Cardinal was at <hi>Frontignan</hi> when he receiv'd the news of the Mareſchal's defeat (who had married one of his Relations) and how much he took it to heart: So he writ him this Letter, which I thought it not amiſs to ſet down. <hi>Men may do all that prudence, and the preſent occaſions ſuggeſt to them, but the event is in the hand of God. The beſt Captain in the world may loſe a Battel; and when ſuch a misfortune befalls him, he ought to comfort himſelf, if he did all that he could and ought to do.

Thus the ill conduct of the Count-Duke, and of the other Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> made that Crown loſe the beſt opportunity they could have deſired, to humble <hi>France,</hi> by carrying the War into the heart of the Kingdom, as the <hi>French</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to do in relation to <hi>Spain.</hi> One may remark upon this occaſion, as upon ſeveral more, that the great incapacity of the Count-Duke made the conduct of the Cardinal-Duke to be ſo much admired; which had frequently appear'd but very indifferent, had he been to deal with people that had been Maſters but of common prudence and diſcretion.</p>

               <p>This reſolution being taken, the King order'd twenty two thouſand effective men, of the beſt Troops in the Kingdom, to march on the ſide of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> and theſe were to be joyn'd by the other forces that were already in <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> beſides abundance of Volunteers.

               <p>Before the King parted for <hi>Languedoc,</hi> all poſſible care was taken for the ſecurity of the other Frontiers of the Kingdom, during his Majeſty's abſence.

               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:54967:171"/>
               <p>All things being diſpoſed after this manner, the Cardinal adviſed the King to carry the Queen and Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> along with him, leſt there ſhould be any caballing againſt his Miniſtry in his abſence. He was of opinion too that the Children of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be left at <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> under a good Guard, where they could run no manner of danger. Theſe ſtrange counſels, which ſuppos'd that the State was in danger, unleſs the perſons that were moſt concern'd in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation were under the eyes or guard of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, gave his enemies an occaſion to ſay that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to deſtroy the King, and make himſelf Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Kingdom. Perhaps he had no ſuch deſign in his head, but his auſtere and haughty way of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt eminent perſons at Court, did every day increaſe the number of his Enemies, and made them ſay ſome things, which otherwiſe they had never ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The Queen broke this deſign which the King had form'd to carry her with him, by telling him all in tears, that ſhe could never endure to be ſeparated from her Children; and, as it was not thought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to expoſe them to ſo tedious a Journey, the King gave her leave to ſtay with him at <hi>St. Germains.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was left at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Title of Regent, during his Majeſty's abſence, and two hundred men aſſign'd him for his Guard.</p>
               <p>Towards the beginning of the year, the Troops march'd on the ſide of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and were follow'd by the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> who was to command them, and by the Vicount <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had the quality of Lieutenant General.

However, 'tis reported that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal advis'd him to take care, never to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any deſign for the future, which tended to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil the Kingdom; telling him that a relapſe would be mortal. The Duke did not much regard this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as what follows will diſcover; and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's prediction was accompliſh'd.</p>

               <p>Before the Generals parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal regaled them magnificently at his Palace, with Monſieur, and ſeveral of the Nobility. In the ſame Hall there was a ſecond Table for the Ladies, which was ſerv'd with the ſame magnificence. The Repaſt was follow'd with a Comedy, which was expreſsly acted for this occaſion.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Candlemas</hi> the King began his Journey, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Cardinal, and both of them flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themſelves that they ſhould be able to carry the War into the bowels of <hi>Spain,</hi> and overthrow that Monarchy, by cauſing a general inſurrection of its Subjects, after the conqueſt of <hi>Rouſillon;</hi> but neither of them knew that Death would ſoon put an end to all the unjuſt projects which the Maſter and his Diſciple (for what fitter name can we give them) had ſaid for ſo many years; the one through weakneſs, the other through ambition. The King being at <hi>Lyons,</hi> made a review of his Troops that were quarter'd about that City, and amounted to fifteen thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> receiving advice of the great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made by the King of <hi>France,</hi> his Catholic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty iſſued out<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The King parted the ſame day from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 313.</note> took the way to <hi>Narbonne.</hi> Being at <hi>Valence,</hi> he gave with his own hands a Cardinals Cap to <hi>Mazarine;</hi> who from that time wholly devoted himſelf to the ſervice of the Crown. The King, altho he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what indiſpoſed, yet he purſued his Journey to <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> through all the inconveniences of Froſt and Snow; and there on the 23d of <hi>March</hi> created two Mareſchals of <hi>France,</hi> the Count <hi>de Guebriant,</hi> and <hi>La Mothe Houdancourt.</hi> Nor did the rigour of the ſeaſon retard the motion of the Army, which on the 17th of <hi>March</hi> went to beſiege <hi>Collioure,</hi> a place of great conſequence, defended by the Marquis <hi>de Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,</hi> with three thouſand men in garriſon. This Port was neceſſary to the <hi>French,</hi> both to hinder the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> from relieving <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> as alſo to make uſe of it themſelves. The Count-Duke knowing the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, ſent orders to <hi>D.

The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54967:173"/>repreſented to him how difficult it was to march through <hi>Catalonia,</hi> a mountainous uneven Country and full of defiles, in ſpight of <hi>la Mothe Houdancourt,</hi> who guarded all the paſſes with extraordinary care. Beſides this, it was the higheſt indiſcretion imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hazard the only Horſe which <hi>Spain</hi> had on that ſide for its defence. But the Count, who was poſitive and inflexible, and naturally affected to have ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments particular to himſelf, did not change his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but diſpatched Orders afreſh to the Marquis, who now prepar'd to ſee them executed, whatever they coſt him. After he had made ſome movements, the better to conceal his march from the Enemies, he took the road from <hi>Ville-Franche</hi> to <hi>Martorel,</hi> with three thouſand five hundred Horſe. But on the 26th of <hi>March</hi> he could not hinder the Mareſchal <hi>de la Mothe,</hi> who ſuſpected his deſign, from cutting part of his Rear in pieces at the paſs of the River <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergue.</hi> Two days after, <hi>la Mothe</hi> gave another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the paſs of another River, paſs'd it after them and oblig'd them to retire into a Wood, after he had killed abundance of their men; ſo that <hi>D. Pedro d' Arragon</hi> reſolv'd at laſt, in ſpite of the reiterated Orders from <hi>Madrid,</hi> to return to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragone.</hi> As he took but ſmall ſtore of Victuals along with him, thinking he ſhould be able to croſs <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> in a few days, they now began to fail him, and the <hi>French</hi> on the other ſide keeping his Army per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in breath, his Troops were extremly fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued without being able to perform any thing. At laſt on the 31ſt of <hi>March,</hi> being ſurrounded on all ſides by the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> without any poſſibility of making his eſcape, <hi>D. Pedro d' Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> ſurrendred himſelf priſoner of War to <hi>la Mothe Houdancourt</hi> with about two thouſand Horſe. Thus the principal Troops which <hi>Spain</hi> had for its own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, were deſtroyed by the ill advice of the Count-Duke, who engaged them in an enterprize which any one elſe would have found extremely difficult, but was abſolutely impoſſible for the Marquis <hi>de Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var</hi> to effect. The <hi>French</hi> Generals immediately ſet the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> at liberty, becauſe they were in war with
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54967:173"/>
                  <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the reſt were ſent to <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> was accuſed to have advis'd the Count-Duke to ſend <hi>D. Pedro d' Arragon</hi> into <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> and perhaps he did it with a deſign to let the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſee, that he was not the only bad General that commanded their Armies, and how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a matter it was to ſurprize the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of the Town of <hi>Collioure,</hi> and nothing now remain'd but the Caſtle, ſituated upon a Rock, which they deſpair'd to reduce by force. But a Mine, from which they expected ſcarce any effect, becauſe the Rock hindred them from carrying it far enough, as it play'd fill'd up the pits of the Caſtle, which was ſupplied with no other Water, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Garriſon to ſurrender, when they the leaſt thought of any ſuch thing. It capitulated on the 10th of <hi>April,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>St. Elme,</hi> which ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an inacceſſible Rock above the Port, was likewiſe comprehended in the capitulation, altho it might have held out ſeveral days longer.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Army march'd to <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and his Majeſty having receiv'd information that the place was but ſlenderly ſtored with proviſions, deſigned to reduce it by Famine rather than by Force. Beſides the ſcarcity of proviſions, which was confirm'd by all the Priſoners that were taken, there was a powerful Garriſon within, and the Cittadel eſpecially was ſo ſtrong by its natural ſituation and by art, that it was not poſſible to take it by force, without loſing a world of men. <hi>D. Flores d' Avila</hi> was Governor of it, and had for his Lieutenant <hi>D. Diego Cavalliero,</hi> and they ſeem'd inclin'd to defend it to the laſt extremity. However the King came thither in perſon, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lines of Circumvallation and Countervallation to be made, which he marked out himſelf.</p>
               <p>At this conjuncture <hi>Spain</hi> found it ſelf in a great perplexity, without Money, the Sinews of War, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſciplin'd Army, and without Generals to command it, while on one ſide the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themſelves from its Obedience, and kept all the neighbourhood in perpetual alarms, and on the other
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54967:174"/>ſide, <hi>France</hi> made continual inroads into <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The Miniſters of the Catholic King met every day, but were not able to come to any concluſion; ſome of them were of opinion that the King ſhould go in perſon to the Kingdoms of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> to aſſemble the States there, that ſo he might at a nearer diſtance provide for the preſſing ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Nobility and People did every where loudly complain, that the Count-Duke made the King fruitleſsly loſe time in deliberations, at the beſt ſeaſon of the year, altho the King of <hi>France</hi> had open'd the Campaign in perſon, before the Winter was over. The Count-Duke was by no means qualified to take any vigorous reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and much leſs to put them in execution with that ſpeed which the preſent face of affairs required, and thus the King began to be ſenſible ſomewhat of the lateſt for the Intereſt of <hi>Spain.</hi> At laſt, he reſolved to go into <hi>Arragon,</hi> notwithſtanding all the artifices of his Favourite; but he ought to have made this Journey the laſt year, before ſo great a number of <hi>French</hi> Troops came into <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Rouſillon.</hi>

               <p>About the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> an engagement hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd on the Coaſts of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> between the Fleets of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which laſted two days, without any great loſs on either ſide; however it proved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely prejudicial to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who could never hope to ſave <hi>Rouſillon</hi> without beating the <hi>French</hi> Fleet. The latter retir'd to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and the other to <hi>Majorca.</hi> The fight had ſcarce begun, when a man, pretending himſelf to be ſent by the Duke <hi>de Cindad-Real,</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, took poſt to carry the news to the King, that the Duke had gain'd an entire Victory, and taken from the <hi>French</hi> ſixty Ships, and ten Gallies.

The King and the Favourite, tranſported with joy, without condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to examine the bearers of this news, diſpatch'd <hi>Dominic d' Herrera</hi> to the Queen, to give her advice of this Victory, and ſhe preſented him with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns, and a Golden Chain. At the ſame time orders were ſent to the Marquis <hi>de Torrecuſe,</hi> who was upon his march, to ſtay where he was, till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd freſh orders, becauſe the Victory which the Fleet had gain'd, open'd a paſſage by Sea to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> forces; and thus they made him loſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of relieving <hi>Perpignan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after a Bark arrived at <hi>Veneros,</hi> which brought a true relation of the engagement; and they no ſooner heard the news at Court, but they were in a ſtrange confuſion, for having ſo ſlightly believ'd a thing of that importance, and diſperſing wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations all over the Kingdom. From extremity of joy the King paſt to extremity of ſorrow, and ſent a ſecond order to the Marquis <hi>de Torrecuſe,</hi> wherein he expreſsly forbid him to hazard a Battel upon any terms, till he had received a freſh reinforcement.

               <p>At this time the Cardinal fell extremely ill in this City, of a diſtemper in his arm, which he formerly had been troubled with, and two impoſthumes that were form'd in his breaſt, as I ſhall obſerve when I come to his laſt ſickneſs.

In the Camp at <hi>Perpignan</hi> the whole Army was divided into two Factions, one of them named <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> the other <hi>Cardinaliſts,</hi> but it ſeems the braveſt men in the Army declared for the former.</p>
               <p>The King being in the Army fell dangerouſly ill there, but his illneſs did not laſt long. In the mean time, the Maſter of the Horſe aſſured himſelf of the Guards and <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> and made the Officers promiſe to ſerve the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in the diſpute that would ariſe between him and the Cardinal, concerning the Megence. The Mareſchals <hi>de Schomberg,</hi> and <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> were Heads of the contrary party; but if the King had died, in all probability they would have tack'd about. In the mean time, the favour of the Maſter of the Horſe daily diminiſhed, and now there remain'd little more than a feeble appearance of it, which he preſerved as long as he was able: The King had no more any of thoſe long Conferences which he uſed to have with him when he was in Bed. This
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54967:177"/>great alteration occaſioned <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> to preſs Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur inceſſantly to retire to <hi>Sedan,</hi> while the King importun'd him to come to <hi>Perpignan.</hi> But the Duke neither moved for the one nor the other: He did not obey the King, under pretence of his Gout, for which reaſon he was adviſed to go to the Waters of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> and he did not go to <hi>Sedan,</hi> becauſe he could not do it without an order in writing from the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> to the Governor of that place, which he had forgot to ask him for, before he paſt the Mountains. He was therefore obliged to ſend for it, and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted <hi>Montmor</hi> with this Commiſſion, to whom the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> refuſed to give the order he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, becauſe he did not know him. So after him was ſent the Count <hi>d' Aubijouv,</hi> one of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur's Domeſtics, who departed in the habit of a Capuchin.</p>
               <p>In this interim, the Cardinal being ſtill ſick at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and the King before <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter received advice from <hi>Spain,</hi> that a certain <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was ſeen in the Count-Duke's Anti-chamber; and it was every where diſcourſed, that the Cardinal's enemies had made a Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> but at that time the Miniſter was not able to procure a Copy of the Treaty. This kept him in a perpetual inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and he deſir'd the King to come to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> under a pretence of entertaining him about ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the greateſt conſequence. But he deſir'd it to no purpoſe, the King being obſtinately reſolved not to quit the Blockade of <hi>Perpignan.</hi> The Cardinal likewiſe obſerved, that the King enquired very neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently after his health, which made him apprehend, that his Enemies had gain'd an entire aſcendant over the King's inclinations. He did not imagine himſelf ſafe at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> ſo pretending that the Air of that City did not agree with him, and that his Phyſitians adviſed to go to the Waters of <hi>Tareſcon,</hi> he departed from thence, and when he took any road he cauſed a report to be ſpread before, that he went another way; he often changed the road, and embarked at <hi>Ayde</hi> to go part of the way by water, that ſo in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he might retire into <hi>Italy.</hi> Nay, 'tis ſaid that he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54967:178"/>had got all his Money ready, to be carry'd away with the firſt order, as well as his Jewels.</p>

                     <hi>Mem.</hi> T. 2. p. 841.</note> Billet of the King, dated the; of <hi>June,</hi> wherein he aſſures him, <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reports were ſcattered abroad to his diſadvantage, he loved him more than ever; and that they had been now too long together, to think of parting, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired all the world ſhould know.</hi> This Billet was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to remove all his ſuſpicions, but the indiſcreet conduct of the Maſter of the Horſe, who neither knew how to conceal his deſign, nor to preſerve himſelf in the Kings favour, gave him a greater ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Thus while Monſieur and the Maſter of the Horſe were deliberating upon what they had to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming to any reſolution, the Cardinal receiv'd a Pacquet, wherein he found a Copy of the Treaty of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi> Some people ſay it was the Nuncio in <hi>Spain</hi> that ſent it to him: Others name other perſons. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſo unwiſe as to let a Copy be taken of it, they committed an unpardonable Soleciſm; and if this Copy came from the Conſpirators, the fault was ſtill the greater. However it came about, the Cardinal no ſooner procured it, but he ſent <hi>Chavigny</hi> to the King to ſhow it him, and to deſire him to cauſe <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> to be apprehended. <hi>Chavigny</hi> had all the trouble in the world to make his Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to deliver this Criminal into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. He fell down upon his knees, and pray'd to God to inſpire him with the beſt reſolution, and ſent for F. <hi>Sirmond</hi> a Jeſuite, and his Confeſſor, to ask his advice. The Father Confeſſor was not backward to tell him, that after ſo enormous a crime as this was, the King need not ſcruple to order his Favourite to be apprehended. According to the cuſtom of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, to apprehend any one for a crime againſt the State, and to put him to death, was in a manner the ſame thing; as if it had been unlawful, once in his life, to have ſhown mercy to ſome of the Cardinals Enemies.</p>
               <p>As it was a nice and difficult matter to apprehend the Maſter of the Horſe in the Army, where he was extremely beloved, the King was reſolved to go to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54967:178"/>
                  <hi>Narbonne,</hi> under a pretence that he had an Ague, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he could never be perſwaded to go to that City, while the Cardinal was there. At that time he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to confer with him about the affairs of <hi>Picardy,</hi> which ſeem'd to be in danger, after the defeat of the Mareſchal <hi>de Guiche.</hi> Being therefore arrived at <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> while the Cardinal was at <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of the Horſe, whoſe place would not give him leave to be from the King, follow'd him thither, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he was before-hand inform'd that his deſigns were diſcovered. Thus he was apprehended on the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> altho he hid himſelf, and the houſes were once ſearch'd to no purpoſe, the King having given orders before that the City gates ſhould be ſhut. <hi>De Thou</hi> was likewiſe apprehended the night before, with one <hi>Chavignac</hi> a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> and ſome of their Servants. Theſe two laſt were afterwards carried under a ſtrong Guard to <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> and the other to the Cittadel of <hi>Montpellier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Oſſonville,</hi> Lieutenant of the Guards to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who ſent him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Maſter of the Horſe, being inform'd that he was apprehended, took poſt to carry this news to the Duke, that ſo he might take his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures accordingly. He paſt through <hi>Monfrin,</hi> a Town of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> over againſt <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where the Vicount <hi>de Turenne</hi> was, to whom he thought he was oblig'd to tell this news. The Vicount, who knew nothing of the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, and who thought the Cardinal knew no more of it than himſelf, believ'd he would take it kindly to be inform'd of it; ſo he ſent to acquaint him, at the ſame time that he receiv'd this news from <hi>Oſſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> who was going into <hi>Italy.</hi> The Cardinal no ſooner underſtood it, but he immediately diſpatch'd a man with neceſſary orders to ſtop <hi>Oſſonville,</hi> whom he apprehended at <hi>Valence,</hi> and there impriſon'd him.<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54967:179"/>to fetch the Kings order to ſhew it him. Thus the Duke and the Maſter of the Horſe were taken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proſpect of eſcaping, partly through their own imprudence, and partly through that peculiar good fortune of the Miniſter, from whom very few of his Enemies eſcaped, while he luckily withdrew himſelf from the moſt eminent dangers. The Duke was for ſome time kept under a Guard in the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of <hi>Caſal,</hi> but was removed in <hi>Auguſt</hi> to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and lodged in the Priſon of <hi>Pierre-Anciſe.</hi>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> receiving advice that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Horſe was apprehended, inſtead of finding out means to ſave and retrieve his friends, relapſed into his uſual weakneſs, and thinking himſelf diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, ſent the Abbot of <hi>la Riviere</hi> from <hi>Moulins,</hi> where he then was, to the King, to confeſs his fault, and beg his pardon. He writ at the ſame time Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<note n="*" place="margin">See them in the Mem. of <hi>Montr. p. 162.</hi>
                  </note> dated the 25th of <hi>June,</hi> to the King, to the Cardinals of <hi>Richlieu</hi> and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and to <hi>De Noyers</hi> and <hi>Chavigny,</hi> Secretaries of Eſtate, full of mean ſubmiſſions and lyes, either to beg mercy, or to deſire Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> and the two Secretaries to aſſiſt him to obtain it. However, the Duke burnt the Original of the Treaty, which <hi>Fontrailles</hi> had brought him from <hi>Spain,</hi> and only kept one Copy of it, which he might likewiſe have burnt had he ſo pleaſed; ſo that if he had been maſter of any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it had been impoſſible to have convicted him of any thing. The King pardoned him, after this indiſcreet diſcovery, upon condition that he would go to <hi>Niſy</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> a Houſe of the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> where he was to reſide, with a penſion of 200000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres; the reſt of his Revenues being ſtopt to ſatisfie his Creditors. Monſieur deſir'd to ſee the King before he went thither, but the King refuſed him that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the Marquis <hi>de Villeroy</hi> had orders to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him.<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 171, 175, 195.</note> At firſt they had ſome deſigns to ſend him to <hi>Venice,</hi> as it appears by ſeveral Letters, but at laſt they changed their reſolution. Neither did he go to <hi>Niſy,</hi> ſo that 'tis probable the true reaſon why they pretended to make him leave the Kingdom, was only to oblige him to diſcover all he knew.</p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:54967:179"/>
               <p>In the mean time the Secretaries of State were not wanting to incenſe his Majeſty againſt the Priſoners; and the Abbots <hi>d' Effiat</hi> and <hi>de Thou</hi> expreſſing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to intercede for their Brothers, he ſent them word that he would not ſee them. The King ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to be indiſpos'd, and being now reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Cardinal prevail'd with him to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf to be carried to <hi>Monfrin,</hi> within a league of <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> that he might there ſee him. To this end, in the Chamber where the Cardinal lay, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bed was prepared for the King, which was ſet up at his arrival. None but <hi>de Noyers</hi> and <hi>Chavigny</hi> were preſent at this viſit. 'Tis reported, that the Cardinal, after he had with great vehemence ennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated the ſervices he had done the Crown, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the King for countenancing the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies againſt his perſon, by ſuffering the Maſter of the Horſe to be with him, after his Majeſty knew what deſigns he had formed againſt him. This diſcourſe drew tears from the King, who recounted to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal all that had paſt in his diſadvantage, which he knew of, and promiſed to leave the Conſpirators to Juſtice. At laſt, the King took the way to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and the Cardinal ſtill continued at <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> got the<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 161.</note> Secretaries to ask him, <hi>Whether in important and preſſing affairs he might give orders as he ſhould judge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, for his Majeſty's Service, as he had frequently commanded him to do.</hi> In caſe the King conſented to this propoſal he deſired he would write to him, as from his own proper motion. The King was ſoon prevailed upon to do what he deſired, and writ to him a<note n="*" place="margin">Aubery <hi>Mem.</hi> T. 2. p. 841.</note> Letter on the laſt day of <hi>June,</hi> wherein he tells him, that being conſtrain'd by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own affairs, as well as the Cardinal's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indiſpoſition to leave him in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, that he ſhould manage all matters there which concerned the State, with the ſame authority as if the King himſelf was there in perſon, and that he ſhould provide for all urgent affairs, without ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for directions. The Cardinal return'd this<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 2 <hi>of</hi> July, Montreſ. 181.</note> anſwer to the King, that as he had never abuſed the honours he had been pleaſed to do him, ſo he would
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54967:180"/>uſe that power, with which his Majeſty had entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, with all due moderation.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had indeed confeſt at firſt, in general Terms, that he had kept a very particular correſpondence with the Maſter of the Horſe, and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and promis'd to inform the Cardinal of all the particulars, but they deſired that he would give them the detail in writing: There was ſome difficulty to obtain it, but at laſt he made a<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. 211.</note> Declaration on the 7th of <hi>July,</hi> wherein he diſcover'd all that he knew. It is daced from <hi>Aigueperce</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne,</hi> where he had leave given him to ſtay, inſtead of going to <hi>Savoy.</hi> In fine, he engaged himſelf to do every thing they would have him, to convict his friends of this conſpiracy, provided they would ſuffer him to live in the Kingdom, privately, and without any retinue but ſuch as the King would be pleaſed to allow him.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> being informed that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> had confeſſed all, was induced to own all his engagements with the Maſter of the Horſe, and their deſigns againſt the Cardinal, only he denied that he gave his conſent to the Treaty of <hi>Madrid.</hi> To carry on this proceſs and pronounce ſentence againſt the Criminals, the Cardinal, according to his cuſtom, nominated ſome Commiſſioners who appeared at the places aſſign'd, and performed all the neceſſary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities. The Chancellor was the Chief of them, and the reſt were <hi>Laubardemont, Marca, Miraumes, Nil, De Paris, Champigny,</hi> Counſellors of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of his Majeſty; <hi>De Chaze,</hi> and <hi>De Leve,</hi> likewiſe Counſellors of the King, and Maſters of the ordinary Requeſts of his Houſhold.</p>
               <p>While this Proceſs was preparing, the Cardinal, who continued ſtill at <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> received advice that the Q. Mother, his ancient Benefactreſs, and for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years one of the principal objects of his hatred, died at <hi>Colen</hi> on the third of <hi>July.</hi> He cauſed a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſervice to be celebrated for her in the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giat Church, as if he deſign'd to make her ſome repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after her death, for all the evil he had done her while ſhe was alive. 'Tis ſaid his Majeſty was
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54967:180"/>extremely grieved at this News, and that his natural affection began but too late to revive, when he came to conſider that through his onw want of tenderneſs, and to ſatisfy a rigorous inflexible Miniſter he had ſuffer'd his Mother to dye in baniſhment and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and never would hearken to a reconciliation with her, altho ſhe ſo earneſtly deſired it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal ſtill tarried at <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> when finding himſelf ſomewhat better, he began to think of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Paris.</hi> As he was not entirely reſtored to his health, and apprehended leſt he ſhould renew his diſtemper by being jolted in a Coach, he cauſed a ſort of a Litter to be contrived wherein was his Bed, with a little Table and a Chair for one perſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and confer with him. It was cover'd with Damask, with a Wax covering over that, to ſerve in time of rain. This Litter was to be carried by eighteen men, and the Cardinal had reſolved to chooſe Peaſants for that Employment, but his Guards offer'd their ſervice to him, and relieved one another by turns, as heretofore <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Souldiers did upon a like occaſion. When they were upon this duty, thoſe that carried the Litter walked with their heads uncovered. As this Litter was too large to enter the Gates of ſome Towns, they were forced to beat down the walls of all thoſe places through which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was minded to paſs, as well as the walls of the Houſes where he lodged, and brought his portable Chamber. Nay, the Roads muſt be enlarged when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they happen'd to be too narrow, and levelled where they were too uneven. Thus our ambitious Miniſter travell'd about two hundred Leagues in this Triumphant Bed, and if I may be allowed the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, enter'd every where through a breach, after he had equally ruin'd his private enemies, and deſtroy'd all the priviledges of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To return to the Conſpirators, <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> having been<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer. T. 2. l. 3. p. 1182, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> carried to <hi>Lyons</hi> and examined, reſolutely maintain'd at firſt that what Monſieur depoſed againſt him was falſe. He ſhowed the ſame conſtancy when he was confronted with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> tho he was extremely ſurprized at it. What perplexed the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54967:181"/>Judges upon this occaſion, was that having only one Copy of the Treaty, it was a difficult matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Maſter of the Horſe without his confeſſion. They uſed all imaginable means to extort the truth out of <hi>de Thou,</hi> whom both Monſieur and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> affirmed to know the whole affair, except only the League with <hi>Spain,</hi> but he proteſted that he knew nothing of what they asked him, and that the only reaſon why he had endeavoured to cement a friendſhip between the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> was upon ſome particular conſiderations which were not in the leaſt criminal. It was diſcourſed, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was to confront the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but he ſo earneſtly begged of the King to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt him from it, and ſo poſitively declared that he would rather fly to the end of the world, than be brought to ſo ſcandalous a paſs, that contrary to all equity and juſtice, his bare teſtimony was to go for valid without any perſonal appearance, provided he would anſwer to the interrogatories of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in the preſence of ſeven Commiſſioners. In the mean time <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> having declared he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs all, if they would promiſe him his life, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſent <hi>Laubardemont</hi> the Regiſter of this Tryal to him, who promiſed it him upon condition, he would ſpeak the truth againſt <hi>De Thou,</hi> who had, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, depoſed againſt him. He fell into this Snare, and being interrogated on the 12th of <hi>September</hi> by the Chancellor and the other Commiſſioners, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all, and as for what related to <hi>De Thou,</hi> depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> had been communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by <hi>Fontrailles</hi> at <hi>Carcaſſonne,</hi> but that he proteſted againſt this deſign, and heartily-condemn'd it: Nay, that he had ſaid more than once, that if he were not afraid of the great credit of the Criminals, he would go to diſcover all to the King, and that he had endeavour'd to diſſwade the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> from this attempt, which he thought would miſcarry for ſeveral reaſons. Not long after, <hi>De Thou</hi> was brought to his examination, who at firſt denied all, but being confronted by <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> confeſſed all, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he added, that he had done all that lay in his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54967:181"/>power to make the Maſter of the Horſe quit this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; that he had frequently quarrelled with him for coming to theſe extremities, without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what might be the conſequence of them; and laſtly, that being but very imperfectly inſtructed in this affair, and having no proofs of it in his hands, to convince the Criminals before the King, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not look upon himſelf obliged to reveal all he knew of the matter, eſpecially ſince the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were not in a condition to make it ſucceed. <hi>De Thou</hi> thought it the beſt way to confeſs all, without ſuffering himſelf to be farther preſt, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to the Rack, which he extremely dreaded, but could have avoided it by no means, if he had continued to deny the fact.</p>
               <p>The Kings Attorney General was of opinion, that both of them ought to ſuffer for their crime. All the Judges agreed that the Maſter of the Horſe ought to dye, for making a Treaty with the Enemies of the Crown. <hi>De Thou</hi> was likewiſe found guilty of High Treaſon, becauſe he did not diſcover this Treaty as ſoon as he was made acquainted with it; and for ſome violent preſumptions that he had made it his buſineſs to engage the Conſpirators in this union, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the welfare of the State. There were only two of the Judges that voted againſt their being put to death; but <hi>Laubardemont</hi> urged an Edict of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. upon this occaſion, by which thoſe that knew of any deſign levell'd againſt the Government, and don't reveal it, are declared to be guilty of High Treaſon. Thus they were condemned to have their Heads ſtruck off in the Market place at <hi>Terreaux,</hi> and the<note n="*" place="margin">See their Trial in the 2d Tome of the <hi>Merc.</hi> of <hi>Siri l. 3.</hi> and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Death.</note> ſame day Sentence was executed; leſt the King, who had a great kindneſs for the Maſter of the Horſe, and might be induced to have ſome compaſſion for <hi>De Thou,</hi> who was no farther a Criminal than as he had declined to accuſe his Friend, ſhould pardon them. The Cardinal ſtill kept to his beloved Maxim, never to deſtroy and one by halves, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Clemency of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. by a ſpeedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. After all, there is no queſtion to be made, but that the Accuſed were really guilty of deſigning
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:54967:182"/>to get the management of affairs into their own hands without the Kings conſent; and if they had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed their intentions, the people had not been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than they were under the Cardinal, and in all probability the Enemies of <hi>France</hi> had only become more formidable by it. Neither the King, nor they, according to the common opinion, were in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuſtain the weight of affairs with ſuch a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and conduct, as the Cardinal had all along ſhown. They were influenced by a principle of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and envy, and did not act for the real good of the people; and it was better for <hi>France,</hi> that an Ambition, ſupported by ſo little Conduct, ſhould prove fatal to the accuſed, than to behold the greateſt Miniſter ſhe ever had, periſh by their intrigues; and the King made a Slave to ſome perſons, who were more unfit to govern than himſelf. However, if the King had had the Courage to have pardon'd <hi>De Thou,</hi> who was the leaſt guilty among them, he had won the applauſes of the whole Kingdom, and had not in the leaſt ſinned againſt the rules of good policy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chavignac,</hi> a <hi>Hugonot</hi> Gentleman, who had ſerved under the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and whom the Maſter of the Horſe had got to be recalled to the Court, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him in his deſigns, was freed and acquitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he refuſed to be concerned in this matter, altho he openly profeſt himſelf to be an humble ſervant of <hi>Cinq-Mars.</hi> 'Tis certain his innocence appeared ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, ſince he ſo fortunately eſcap'd thoſe Judges, who, as the world reported of them, were ready to find all people guilty, that the Cardinal had a mind to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was accuſed for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a viſit from <hi>De Thou;</hi> who would have fain perſwaded him to embark in this affair; and the Cardinal, who deſired to diſcover all the Accomplices, ſent for him to Court, and got the King to write to him upon that ſcore. The Duke made anſwer that he knew nothing of the matter; but altho his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty writ to him thrice to come to him, he judg'd it more adviſable to pretend an indiſpoſition, and at laſt withdrew into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>As for what concerned the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> the King pardon'd him, upon condition he would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the City and Caſtle of <hi>Sedan,</hi> to be annexed to the Crown, without inſiſting on any other terms but his Life and Liberty; and that he ſhould intirely truſt the Kings generoſity, as for what he might be pleaſed to give him by way of exchange.<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Mer.

As ſoon as he was ſet at liberty, he took poſt to <hi>Montargis,</hi> where the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal then was, to whom he made a viſit; after which, without ſeeing the King, he retir'd into <hi>Champagne,</hi> to the Count <hi>de Rouſſi,</hi> his Brother-in-law, where the Dutcheſs of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was; and from thence to a Caſtle which he had in <hi>Perigord.</hi> This Prince was generally condoled for the loſs he ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but every body was ſurpriz'd, that he ſhould ſo eaſily be drawn into this deſign, immediately after he had fortunately got out of another.</p>
               <p>Thus the Cardinal defeated this Conſpiracy, with great glory to himſelf, and very advantageouſly for the Intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> Altho thoſe that envied his authority were not, properly ſpeaking, enemies of the State, yet as they could not deſtroy this Miniſter but by embroiling the Kingdom, by the help of its real enemies, they furniſhed the other party with a plauſible pretence to accuſe them with deſigning to betray their King and Country. The Cardinal recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the news of the death of <hi>Cinq-Mars</hi> and <hi>De Thou,</hi> almoſt at the ſame time that advice was ſent him of the reduction of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> writ a Letter to the King, which began after this manner: <hi>Sir, your arms are in</hi> Perpignan, <hi>and your Enemies are dead.</hi> In the compaſs of one month, <hi>France</hi> got poſſeſſion of two Places, that were of the laſt importance to her, particularly ſo long as ſhe was engaged in a War with <hi>Spain. Perpignan</hi> ſecured <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> and put her in a condition to preſerve <hi>Catalonia,</hi> in caſe ſhe perſiſted in that reſolution, and <hi>Sedan</hi> hindred the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from entring <hi>France</hi> on that ſide, whereas before if
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:54967:183"/>they gain'd the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> over to their party, which was no difficult matter, they might eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, when ever they pleaſed. On the other hand the affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> went every day worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> IV. having been proclaimed King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> not only reſolved to preſerve the Crown, which was ſo lately put upon his head, but likewiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain all that it formerly poſſeſt in <hi>Afric, America,</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Government of the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> was become ſo odious every where, where the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes</hi> had formerly been, that this deſign ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs happily, at a great diſtance from <hi>Spain</hi> that it had about the <hi>Tagus.</hi> The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extraordinary Joy the News of the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Flouſe of <hi>Braganze,</hi> to which they generally ſubmitted in ſpight of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In the mean time, the new King finding that the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were unable to preſerve their uſurpations, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beat them out of the ancient bounds of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but likewiſe enter'd into the dominions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King, and advanced as far as <hi>Salamanca.</hi> He beſieged ſeveral Towns in <hi>Gallicia, Eſtramadura,</hi> and <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> nay he had certainly made theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the Theatre of the War, by cauſing his Army to ſubſiſt there, if there had been any ſtrong places, or ſuch as were in a condition to be fortified, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Spain</hi> was reduced to an extreme weakneſs thro the great indiſcretion of the Count-Duke, and the diſcontents of ſome Princes, and ſeveral great Lords. The Kingdoms of <hi>Valentia</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> that poſſeſt great privileges, could not without a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible regret ſee them daily infringed. <hi>Catalonia,</hi> which had ſo lately call'd in the <hi>French</hi> for that very reaſon, furniſhed them with a very bad example, and might perhaps influence them to do ſomething of the like nature, if things were not regulated in good time. The Intrigues of the Duke <hi>de Medina Sidonia,</hi> and of the Marquis <hi>d' Alamont</hi> put <hi>Andaluſia</hi> into a tottering condition; which Province was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides incenſed at the change which had lately been made in the Money, which after it had been made to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54967:183"/>go at an exceſſive high rate, was at laſt cried down. Thoſe of <hi>Biſcay</hi> had aſſaſſinated a Farmer who had been ſent thither to introduce marked Paper againſt the Franchiſes of that Country, and were exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd at the puniſhment of the principal Male-contents, who had been wheedled to <hi>Madrid</hi> by the Count-Duke under a promiſe of being pardoned there, and altho this had happen'd many years before, yet they ſtill deeply reſented that perfidious uſage. In ſhort, the exceſſive poverty of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides was inviron'd almoſt on all ſides by <hi>Portugal,</hi> made it incapable to contribute much to the expence of the War. Add to this, that the Catholick King had ſuſtain'd great loſſes in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any advances there, thro the ill conduct of his Generals, and that his <hi>America</hi> Fleet was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that he was forced to borrow Silver Plate of private perſons, to Coin it into Money. The greateſt Governments and Offices had for a long while bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time he cauſed forces to march from all parts, at an incredible expence, to endeavour the relief of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and 'tis very obſervable, that in ſix months time, after he had uſed his greateſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, he could bring no more than thirty thouſand men into the field. To compleat his misfortunes, they arrived too late; for the place which had long ſuffer'd the utmoſt extremities of Famine, and which no one took any care to relieve, was obliged to ſurrender, on the 7th of <hi>September, Don Flores d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vela</hi> delivered it up to the Mareſchal <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> wholly deſtitute of Victuals, but extremely well ſtored with Ammunition: It had an Arſenal ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to arm twenty thouſand Foot and Horſe, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore pieces of Cannon, and three thouſand pounds of Powder, with all other things neceſſary for its defence. The Mareſchal gave the government of it to <hi>Varennes,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> till ſuch time as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54967:184"/>the King ſhould provide otherwiſe for the place.</p>
               <p>This Conqueſt gave no little joy to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of the mighty importance of the place, which covered their Frontiers on that ſide, and made them Maſters of <hi>Rouſillon.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was exceedingly concern'd at it, and could not diſſemble his reſentments, while the Count-Duke affected a certain Gayety, which ſurprized all the World. He imagined by ſo doing to keep the King in heart, who ſeemed to be ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dejected, and to put courage into the Army and People, who were alarm'd at the progreſs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.

But inſtead of placing a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral at the head of them, who was able to raiſe the hopes of <hi>Spain,</hi> he cauſed the Marquis <hi>de Leganez</hi> to be nominated to command them, againſt the general expectation; becauſe this Marquis had not been able to obtain leave to come to Court, but was as it were baniſhed into <hi>Valentia,</hi> by reaſon of the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Allies and the Subjects of <hi>Spain</hi> againſt him; but alth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army conſiſted of ſeventeen thouſand Foot, fifteen hundred Dragoons, and ſix thouſand Horſe, and had forty pieces of Cannon. Almoſt all the Robility of <hi>Spain</hi> was there, and particularly a great number of persons that had formerly ſerved in the Armies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Crown; ſo that they had reaſon to promiſe themſelves good ſucceſs. The Army of the Mareſchal <hi>de la Mothe</hi> conſiſted of no more than about eight thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe, but the experience of the General made amends for the ſmall number of his Troops. There was alſo this difference between the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces and thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> that the latter intirely relyed upon their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, whereas a great part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army loſt their courage, when they ſaw the Marquis <hi>de Torrecuſe</hi> leave them, who was generally eſteemed by all thoſe that knew him. The Armies being in this condition, <hi>Leganez</hi> thought it his beſt way to attack <hi>La Mathe,</hi> and marched towards him in order of Battel, on the firſt of <hi>October.</hi> On the ſeventh the Armes came in ſight of one another, and the <hi>French</hi> being ſenſible of the great inequality of their Troops, endeavour'd to get the advantage of the ground, by poſting, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon imminent places, where they had placed their Cannon; ſo that there was no coming to them
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54967:185"/>without ſuſtaining the whole ſhock of their great Guns. In the mean time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> advanced with extraordinary bravery, and having given a vigorous onſet, immediately diſordered the Cavalry of the Right Wing, and put them to flight, but they were beaten back on the Left, where the Mareſchal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in perſon. The <hi>French</hi> Horſe on the Right Wing abandon'd three pieces of Cannon to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and <hi>Laganez</hi> fearing to loſe them again, gave orders to his men to carry them off from the place to joyn the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Artillery. In this interval his Van-guard which had gained them, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to charge the <hi>French,</hi> ſtopt ſhort till the three pieces of Cannon were carried off, ſo that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal had time to rally his Cavalry, and lead them on again to the Charge. In a ſhort time they return'd the like to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and purſued them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order towards the body of their Army, which they put into confuſion. The inequality of the Troops and the coming on of the night, hindred the Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal from making his advantage of it, and having ſounded a retreat, he retired to his Camp; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon after informed that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, he came back to the Field of Battle, where he paſſed the night to let the Enemy ſee that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the day belonged to him. <hi>Leganez</hi> on his ſide writ to the Court that he had obtain'd a ſignal Victory over the <hi>French,</hi> and that he had taken their Cannon. However the loſs was in a manner e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and it was computed that about five hundred men fell on both ſides, but the ſmall number of the <hi>French</hi> rendred their advantages the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beſides that they had done what they at firſt propoſed, ſince by this means they hinderd the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> from forming the ſiege of <hi>Lerida.</hi> The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> made great rejoycing for this pretended Victory, and 'tis an ancient cuſtom in that Country to feed the people with Chimerical News, by diſſembling or extenuating their loſſes, and repreſenting their Victories to be infinitely greater than in reality they are. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſeldom travel out of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſcarce keep any correſpondence with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54967:185"/>cannot inform themſelves of the truth but by Officers of their own Nation, who ſerve in the King's Armies, and as they are not unacquainted with the Maxims of the Court, take care not to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their loſſes. Thus it is generally believed in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the King's Forces are victorious in all places, and that the remote Provinces in his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtill continue intire, till the Treaties of Peace make them diſcover the contrary.

On the other hand, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Army advanced as far as <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glione del Lago</hi> in <hi>Romagnia,</hi> and ſtruck a terror into <hi>Rome.</hi> At this time the<note n="*" place="margin">Ib.

The <hi>Barberines</hi> being in a great fright, had recourſe to the Miniſters of <hi>France,</hi> and deſired them to interpoſe the authority of the King, to bring this affair to ſome accommodation: Altho they were not ſorry in <hi>France</hi> to ſee theſe diſorders and broils in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet they were afraid leſt the Confederate Princes, ſeeing the happy ſucceſs of the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s enterprize, might form ſome deſigns diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> For this reaſon they were glad of any opportunity to ſtop the progreſs of the League, and they did it effectually, by beginning to negotiate afreſh. The Miniſters of ſeveral Princes, and thoſe of the Pope, met at <hi>Caſtel Georgio</hi> for this purpoſe; but after abundance of propoſals on both ſides, nothing was concluded upon, and yet the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> withdrew his Troops out of the Eccleſiaſtic State. This was the only thing which the <hi>Barberines</hi> deſired, and perhaps the other Powers helped them to deceive the Confederate Princes.</p>
               <p>However, 'tis certain, that during theſe diviſions, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Troops in <hi>Italy,</hi> took <hi>Nice de la Paille</hi> from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by compoſition, dated the 3d of <hi>September.</hi> On the 20th of the following month, the Marquis <hi>de Pianez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> re-took <hi>Verrue;</hi> the taking of which places was of conſequence for the time to come; and Prince <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> made himſelf maſter of the City of <hi>Tortone</hi> at the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> and of the Caſtle on the 25th of <hi>November.</hi> The King, to recompence the ſervices or this Prince, made him a preſent of this Town, and the Territory belonging to it; and after this manner the Campaign ended.

               <p>However the King tarrying ſtill at <hi>S.

As the Cardinal ſhar'd authority with the Prince, and had infinitely more reſolution, conduct, and capacity, he imagin'd that all <hi>France</hi> owed no leſs to him, than they did to <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. But tho the <hi>French</hi> have naturally a profound veneration for the perſon of their Kings, yet they hate their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters when they abaſe their power; ſo that if the Cardinal knew how to make himſelf be feared, yet he could never make himſelf be loved.</p>
               <p>At this time he made another requeſt to the King, which had it been made to any other King, he would certainly have puniſhed the unpardonable inſolence of it; and it was as follows, that whenever he ſhould go to ſee the King for the future, his own Guards might be introduced, and appear in an equal number to thoſe of his Majeſty. This Prince, who believed that all the good ſucceſs of his Armies and Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was faſten'd to the perſon of his Miniſter, and who had been long accuſtom'd to have an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kindneſs for him, receiv'd the Cardinal's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54967:190"/>very mildly, which would have been High Treaſon in any one elſe. This dexterous Miniſter knowing perfectly well the Genius of his Maſter, and being reſolved ſtill to inhance his own value with him, at this time gave out that he would no longer concern himſelf with public affairs. He no longer gave acceſs to the Miniſters of foreign Princes at his own Houſe, with a deſign, as he pretended, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage himſelf in a ſhort time wholly from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. The King being inform'd of theſe diſcourſes, was mightily alarm'd at the News, and was afraid that the Cardinal thought in earneſt to quit that poſt, for the conſervation of which he had levell'd ſo many conſiderable Heads, and committed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acts of injuſtice, that I don't believe there had the like been done in ſeveral reigns, as during the 18 years of his Miniſtry. At this time a certain buſineſs happen'd, whether by accident, or by addreſs of the Miniſter, which ſerved not a little to encreaſe the King's inquietude upon this occaſion. <hi>D' Eſtrade</hi> who reſided at Court, from the part of <hi>Frederic-Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> Prince of <hi>Orang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> ſaid that his Maſter had ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly own'd that he had liſten'd to Propoſitions of a Peace or Truce with <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo ſoon as he heard that the Cardinal was gone from <hi>Marbonne,</hi> and that the favour of the Maſter of the Horſe encreaſed, becauſe he thought that if that Miniſter were once excluded from the public affairs, there could be no dependance for the future upon the ſteadineſs of the conduct of <hi>France.</hi> The King was extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this diſcourſe, when it was related to him, and the Cardinal thought himſelf ſo much obliged to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that he writ to him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix weeks before he dyed, by the abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd <hi>D' Eſtrade,</hi> who returned into <hi>Holland,</hi> in theſe terms.<note n="*" place="margin">Aubery <hi>Mem.</hi> T. 2. p. 844.</note> 
                  <hi>He</hi> (meaning <hi>D' Eſtrade) can inform you how gratefully I acknowledge the advantageous opinion you had of me, both upon the ſcore of my Sickneſs, and the impediments which ſome ill-deſpoſed men would give his Majeſty's affairs. I want words to thank you ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the great favour you have done me on theſe occaſions, but I beſeech you to believe that I will
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:54967:190"/>loſe no opportunity to let you ſee with what ſincerity am,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>However the King could not reſolve at firſt to part with theſe Captains, of whoſe fidelity he had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to doubt, but the Cardinal to extort it from him, diſpatched <hi>Chavigni</hi> one of the Secretaries of State to him, with a writing wherein he deſired his Majeſty to grant him a diſcharge. Upon this the King, contrary to his cuſtom, could not forbear to teſtify his reſentments againſt <hi>Chavigni,</hi> forbidding him to come in his preſence. Nay he added, that as he ſuſpected ſeveral of thoſe that were about the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, it was but juſt that the Miniſter ſhould ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him likewiſe, and named <hi>Chavigni</hi> himſelf and <hi>De Noyers.</hi> He treated the latter very courſly, and did not ſoften till after the repeated inſtances of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazerine.</hi> But after he had vexed himſelf for ſome time, as one private man would do with his equal, he was appeaſed at laſt, and ſacrificed the moſt zealous of his Servants to the Cardinal. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheſs he gave them permiſſion to ſell their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys, and ordered that their Lieutenants ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them in the mean time, and that their penſions ſhould be paid them, where-ever they thought fit to retire. He ſent a Gentleman to <hi>Travelle</hi> to aſſure him that the King loved him as well as ever, and that his favour ſhould never diminiſh by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>The Court being thus purged from the reſt of the Factious, as the Cardinals Creatures expreſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, his authority appear'd in its full extent: But at the ſame time not only the King's health, who was extremely alter'd ever ſince the death of <hi>Cinq-Mars,</hi> but alſo that of the Cardinal began to leſſen ſenſibly, and towards the end of <hi>November</hi> he found himſelf ſeized with an exceeding pain in his ſide, which was accompanied with a Feaver. He had been troubled for ſeveral years with the Hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoids, and that diſtemper had frequently made him ſuffer a great deal of pain, till a Phyſician ſtopt them. But ever ſince that time, as if this too acid blood had thrown it ſelf upon the upper parts, he had a defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54967:191"/>upon his arm, to cure which he was forced to employ Cauſties. However he paſt the year 1641 without any conſiderable inconvenience, but the year following having ſtopped the Ulcer in his Arm, in ſeems the humour, which had an Iſſue there, made two impoſthumes above his Lungs, which ſhortned his days. 'Tis commonly the fate of great perſons to be the worſe ſerved, as for what relates to the cure of their Diſtempers, than ordinary men, for as none but Courtiers can have acceſs to them, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no profeſſion but that of Flattery, 'tis almoſt impoſſible for them to have good Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>As it uſually happens, in ſuch diſtempers as the Cardinal was troubled with, that the Patients are ſometimes better and ſometimes worſe, the hopes of the Relations and Creatures of this Miniſter increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diminiſh'd by turns, and ſometimes joy, and ſometimes ſadneſs was to be read in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. 'Tis credibly reported that the King's rough manner of receiving his laſt pretenſions, altho at laſt he complied with them, did diſcompoſe him, as if the King had been obliged wholly to ſubmit himſelf to his deſires. However 'tis certain, that on the 29th of <hi>November</hi> the pain in his ſide increaſed extremely, ſo that he was blooded twice. It was likewiſe ordered that the Holy Sacrament ſhould be<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>30</hi> which fell on a <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
                  </note> expoſed in all the Churches of <hi>Paris,</hi> to endeavour to obtain his health of God; but theſe Prayers and Ceremonies were no more efficacious, than the intereſſed vows of his Relations. The following day he ſeem'd to be better, and thoſe who deſired his preſervation began to ſay that God himſelf had appeared for it, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the ſame day they were forced to alter their tone; for the pain in his ſide ſtill encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as his Feaver, which was accompanied with great difficulty of breathing, which made his Relations leave him neither by day nor by night. On the 2d of <hi>December</hi> a conſult of Phyſicians was held, the reſult of which was, that the Cardinal had but a ſhort time to live. The King being inform'd of the extremity he was in, made him a viſit, and ſpoke to him with a great deal of tenderneſs and concern.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54967:191"/>The Cardinal told him among other thing, <q>That he took his leave of his Majeſty, knowing that he was condemned to pay in a ſhort time the common Tribute which all men owe to Nature: That he ſaid this laſt adien to his Majeſty with the entire ſatisfaction he felt, that he had never done any thing in his whole life contrary to his ſervice: That he left <hi>France</hi> in the higheſt reputation it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had injoy'd in the world, and her Enemies on the other hand humbled; that he asked no other recompence of his Majeſty for all his toils and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, than the continuance of his Royal protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Relations, to whom he would not give his Benediction, but upon the condition they would always preſerve an inviolable fidelity to the King; that laſtly, he requeſted his Majeſty not to change the Miniſtry, ſince thoſe that were then concerned in the adminiſtration of publick affairs, were extremely fit and capable to ſerve the Crown.</q> To theſe he added ſome important inſtructions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the Grandeur of the Kingdom, which were never publiſhed, but 'tis ſaid they have been ſince followed. The King by his anſwers teſtified how much he was concern'd at the Cardinals condition, and promiſed him to protect his Relations, with whom as he ſaid he had other reaſons to be well ſatisfied. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards two yolks of Eggs being brought to him, the King took them and gave them to him with his own hand. After this, he confeſt himſelf to <hi>M. de Leſcot,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres</hi> elect, from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived abſolution. At laſt, he asked the Phyſicians how long they thought he might live? who told him, that ſince they ſaw him ſo unconcern'd to dye, they would not diſſemble with him, that they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his diſtemper as yet was deſperate, and that he muſt wait till the ſeventh day. However, finding himſelf much worſe towards the evening, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> and the Curate of <hi>S. Enſtachias</hi> brought it to him. As he entred, he cry'd out: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my Judge, who will ſoon pronounce my Sentence: I deſire him with all my heart to condemn me, if in my Miniſtry I have propoſed any other end to my ſelf than
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54967:192"/>the good of Religion and of the State.</hi> Next morning,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 3 <hi>of</hi> Decem.</note> at break of day, he would receive the Extreme Unction, and the Curate having told him that it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a perſon of his rank to paſs through all the ordinary forms which others are oblig'd to do, he would not ſuffer himſelf to be treated otherwiſe than as a common man. Thus after he had recited to him the principal Articles of Belief, he ſaid, <hi>That he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them with a perfect Faith, and that he deſired to have a thouſand lives, to ſacrifice them all for the Faith, and for the Church.</hi> As he demanded of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he forgave his enemies? he anſwer'd, <hi>That he did it with all his heart, and after the ſame manner as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the divine juſtice to uſe him.</hi> And being asked, that in caſe God would be pleas'd to grant him a longer life, whether he would employ it better in his ſevice than the time paſt? he reply'd, <hi>May God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſend me a thouſand Deaths, if he foreſees that I ſhall conſent to one mortal ſin.</hi> He likewiſe recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to the Prayers of the ſtanders by, in a manner that ſenſibly affected them; and a man that had lived all along conformable to the precepts of the Goſpel, could not have teſtified a greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God.</p>
               <p>Altho he was given over by his Phyſicians, and there was no likelihood for him to recover, an Emperic of <hi>Troyes,</hi> named <hi>le Fevre,</hi> being preſented to him, and having boaſted extraordinary matters of I don't know what ſort of a Water and Pills he had, the Cardinal was willing to try the experiment, whether he knew more than the reſt of his profeſſion. The ſame day he took ſome of his Water and Pills before dinner, and ſeem'd to be ſomewhat the better for them; however he continu'd to take his leave of thoſe that were about him, with a ſtrong hearty voice, and a ſerence countenance, and appear'd not to have the leaſt concern upon his mind. The King came to ſee him again after dinner, and expreſt all imaginable marks of a real affection. About five a clock, having taken a new Pill, he fancied himſelf to be much better; and on the 4th of <hi>December</hi> in the morning, after he had taken ſome Phyſick, his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54967:192"/>Fever ſeem'd to be abated, and his Friends thought him out of danger. But in a few hours he ſell into ſo great a weakneſs, that they eaſily perceiv'd him to be now in his laſt agonies. Then a certain Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whoſe name was <hi>Pere Leon,</hi> kneeling before his Bed, asked him, if, being now in the laſt mom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nts of his life, when he was going to render an account to God of all his actions, and was upon the brink of Eternity, he would not receive the laſt Abſolution. The Cardinal giving a ſign that he deſired it, the Religious replyed, that while the delluxion took away the free uſe of his Tongue, he ought to joyn in Spirit to what was ſaid; and for a ſign of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance, he deſir'd him to ſqueeze his hand, which he did. After this, the uſual Prayers for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons were ſaid, and they gave him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpoonfuls of Wine to ſupport him. In the mean time a cold ſweat ſeized him, and about noon, as he repeated <hi>In manus tuas Domine,</hi> he gave up the Ghoſt, without any ſtruggling or violence. Thus died this great Miniſter, in the fifty eighth year of his life, the eighteenth of his Miniſtry, and the ninth month of his ſickneſs, after a Fever of ſix days conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54967:193"/>Coffers. He likewiſe deſired that his Library might be kept entire, and that the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> might name three perſons, out of which number the Dukes of <hi>Richlieu</hi> might chooſe one, to be <hi>Bibliothecaire,</hi> with a penſion of a thouſand Livres <hi>per annum.</hi> Beſides this, he rewarded all thoſe that had ſerved him, and with whom he was ſatisfied, unleſs he had otherwiſe recompenced them when he was alive. When a man compares his Legacies and his other Donations with thoſe that abundance of Princes reward their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with, he fancies he reads the Teſtament of a King when he reads his, and that he ſees the Wills of private perſons when he reads thoſe of ſome Princes. Tho he left a prodigious wealth to <hi>Armand de Maille,</hi> his Nephew, and his other Heirs, yet it may with juſtice be affirm'd, that he did not drain the Royal Exchequer to enrich them; that he ſcarce ever ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Kings Armies to want, and that he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no favourable opportunity, for want of being at ſome expence, which are the ordinary faults that moſt Miniſters of State may be charged with.</p>
               <p>His Body being open'd, the Doctors found two Impoſthumes, one of them had broke ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the other kill'd him in the breaking.

I leave it to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts and Philoſophers to paſs their judgment upon this remark. His Body lay expoſed to publick view three or four days in his Cardinal's habit upon a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card Bed. A Duke's Coronet lay at his feet on one ſide, and on the other a Ducal Mantle. At the Beds feet ſtood a Croſs, and ſeveral Silver Flambeaux adorn'd with lighted Tapers. On the 13th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> his Body was carried to the Church of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> upon a Chariot cover'd with a Pall of black Velvet, croſſed with white Sattin, on which were
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54967:193"/>his Arms. This Chariot was drawn by ſix Horſes, with coverings trailing on the ground of the ſame Stuff. His Pages marched on his ſide with Tapers of white Wax in their hands. An infinite number of people followed the Herſe, ſome in Coaches, others on Horſeback, and on foot. On the 28th of <hi>January</hi> a ſolemn ſervice was celebrated for him at <hi>Notre-Dame,</hi> to which the Soveraign Courts were invited. The terms of the invitation were as follow: <hi>Noble and devont perſons, pray for the Soul of the moſt high, moſt powerful and moſt virtuous, the moſt illuſtrious and eminent Lord</hi> ARMAND JOHN DU PLESSIS, <hi>Cardinal of</hi> Richlieu, <hi>Duke, Peer, Grand Maſter, and Intendant of the Navigation, and Commerce of</hi> France; <hi>one of the Prelates, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Order of the Holy Ghoſt; Chief of the Council, and Principal Miniſter of State to the King; for whoſe Soul, Services and Prayers ſhall be kept in the Church of</hi> Paris; <hi>in which place next</hi> Monday <hi>after noon will be ſaid the</hi> Veſpers <hi>and Vigils of the Dead; and on</hi> Tueſday <hi>the day following his ſolemn ſervice will be celebrated, at ten in the morning.

               <p>Such was the Death, and ſuch was the Funeral of the Cardinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> whoſe<note n="*" place="margin">Siri.

He was of a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and his unwearied application to buſineſs ſtill made it weaker. As for his Wit, it was quick and lively, and at the ſame time piercing and vaſt, and capable of all affairs of State. His Judgment was profound and ſolid in theſe ſorts of things. He could not bear an injury, and nothing was more agreeable and pleaſing to him than Revenge. He was proud and choleric, yet at the ſame time affable and full of ſweetneſs and civility. He diſcourſed eaſily and with eloquence enough, a talent which he had
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:54967:194"/>acquired and cultivated by ſtudy, as well as by practice. He was not deſtitute of Learning, which he had carried to a much higher pitch, if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his ſtudies with the ſame warmth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry as he began them. He was courageous and undaunted in time of danger where the State was concerned, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Rec. T. 8. p. 670.</note> 'tis ſaid he had three beloved ones, which are worthy of obſervation, and were principally learnt from himſelf. I. He ſaid, that in matters of great importance, he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently experimented it, that perſons of the leaſt wiſdom oftentimes gave the beſt expedients. For this reaſon he concluded that a man ought always to take advice. II. He ſaid, that thoſe reſolutions which he had taken up in a heat and paſſion, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſucceeded ill with him, and that he had hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily repented of them. III. He has been heard to ſay, that men of Quality ought to take great care that the Servants they keep in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or about their perſons, be not too pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, becauſe it may ſo happen, that by the leaſt word, nay, even by the leaſt ſign, they may in ſpite of themſelves diſcover their moſt ſecret ſentiments, and their moſt hidden deſigns.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who were Favourites of the King, after the<note n="*" place="margin">Siri Merc. T. 2. l. 8.</note> Conſtable <hi>de Luines,</hi> as for example, <hi>Baradas</hi> and <hi>S. Simon</hi> were content to enjoy his Majeſty's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, without concerning themſelves with State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; but the Cardinal was no ſooner taken into favour, but he undertook the adminiſtration of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54967:194"/>thing. He was arbitrator of all the deliberations in reſpect of Peace and of War, Maſter of the Finances, and diſpenſer of all the King's favours. He diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the ſtrongeſt places belonging to the State, and of all Offices that depended upon the Court; ſo that the greateſt perſons ſtrove for his favour with no leſs zeal and application than even the meaneſt.</p>
               <p>The King had an extraordinary affection for him at firſt, but this friendſhip was mightily leſſen'd in his latter years, through the too aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming behaviour of the Cardinal, who often treated him as his equal. Nevertheleſs the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fearfulneſs of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII, and the great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of this Miniſter hindered him from find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ill effects of this coldneſs. The King had more than once ſhown himſelf ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to diſcard him from all publick buſineſs, eſpecially when he ſent him word by the Duke of <hi>Angouleme,</hi> as ſome report, that he thought it proper for him to diſmiſs his Guards, which had been granted him for his ſecurity: To which the Cardinal made anſwer, that he was ready to obey his Majeſty in that and every thing beſides, but that while the King made uſe of his perſon, he would pretend to live in ſafety, and to preſerve himſelf from thoſe Conſpiracies which ſome factious perſons might form againſt him.</p>
               <p>For fear of being overwhelmed under the weight of public affairs, which the weakneſs of his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not ſuffer him to attend perpetually, he aſſigned certain hours for recreation, where he would not hear the leaſt mention made of any thing that demanded too much application. For this reaſon he kept <hi>Boiſrobert</hi> about him, who diverted him with a thouſand agreeable ſtories, and told him all the news of the Court and City, proper to make him laugh. Among his other amuſements, we may reckon the great pleaſure he took to ſpeak of the <hi>French</hi> Language and Poetry. The Author of <hi>the Hiſtory of the Academy</hi> has related ſeveral conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:54967:195"/>ſtories to this purpoſe, which I ſhall not ſet down here, becauſe I have propoſed to my ſelf to write the Hiſtory of the Cardinal's Miniſtry, and not of his private diverſions. The Reader may conſult the above-mentioned Author, as for what he ſays of our Miniſter, upon the occaſion of his eſtabliſhing the <hi>French</hi> Academy. Nay, he gave orders that no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult affairs ſhould be propoſed to him but one after another; and he employ'd both for his own in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and for thoſe of the State, <hi>de Noyers, Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thillier,</hi> and <hi>Chavigni,</hi> altho there were ſome which he only communicated to the King.</p>
               <p>After he had taken ſuch meaſures as he judged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the preſervation of his own perſon, he thought of nothing with more application, than how to maintain himſelf in this eminent poſt; which it was no eaſie matter for him to do, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great numbers of envious and diſaffected people whom he had made. Daily endeavours were uſed to poſſeſs the King with ſuſpicions to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of our Miniſter; and 'tis certain, that this inconſtant, diſtruſtful Prince, whoſe dark Genius was ſo hard to be found out, gave him no ſmall trouble. And therefore, to hinder his Majeſty from being prejudic'd againſt him, before he could be able to juſtifie himſelf, he took care to remove all thoſe perſons from about him whom he in the leaſt ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and only left ſuch near him as depended abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely upon himſelf. As he ſaw that the King was ſcrupulous, and that the fear of doing ſomething againſt his Conſcience, held him ſometimes in a long deliberation, prejudicial to the affairs of the State, he would be the director of his Conſcience, and eaſe him of thoſe ſcruples which embaraſs'd him. He pretended that the Kings Confeſſor ought to follow his Maxims, and got Father <hi>Gauſſin</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to be diſmiſſed, becauſe he would not be obedient to him.</p>
               <p>The greateſt ambition of this Miniſter was to reign, and make a noiſe in the world; to which end it behoved him to preſerve himſelf in his poſt, and to render himſelf abſolutely neceſſary to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54967:195"/>the King. This he effected, by engaging him ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly in ſome new enterprize or other, becauſe it was an infallible Maxim with this Prince, never to part with any Miniſter, till he had concluded the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs which he had begun; and beſides, he did not look upon himſelf to be able to govern the State of himſelf. He ſaw that the King on one ſide was but indifferently affected to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and on the other very much inclined to a Peace. To ſatisfie theſe two inclinations, he promis'd to humble that Crown ſo effectually, that this ſhould produce a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſecure Peace to <hi>France.</hi> The King, altho of a ſoft and peaceable diſpoſition, yet he was no enemy to what might obtain him a reputation in the world, provided the undertaking would not give him too much trouble; and the Cardinal took care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch projects to him as were proper to make a noiſe, and engaged for the ſucceſs of them. Thus he made himſelf Maſter of the King's mind, and did what he pleaſed under his name.</p>
               <p>For his own glory, he voluntarily engaged in mighty deſigns, and as he was fortunate enough in his Wars, ſo he loſt no opportunity to make new Conqueſts, and employ'd all ſort of artifiees to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh them. He laid the foundation of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Monarchy, and did not deſpair of compleating it by the ruin of <hi>Spain,</hi> to which he gave two dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous blows, by ſupporting the Rebellion of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonians</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To facilitate the execution of theſe vaſt projects, it was neceſſary before all things to ſecure <hi>France</hi> from the invaſions of her Neighbours, and to put her in a condition to pour down her Forces where-ever ſhe ſhould ſee convenient. This he began to perform with a great deal of ſucceſs. <hi>Paris</hi> lying too near the Frontiers of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and having been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified more than once by the incurſions of the Enemy, ever ſince the time of <hi>John de Worth,</hi> the Cardinal endeavour'd to enlarge the Frontiers of the Kingdom on that ſide, which he did by the Conqueſt of <hi>Artois,</hi> and which he had continued by the reduction of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, which would have ſerved as a Rampart
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54967:196"/>to <hi>France,</hi> if he had lived. He colour'd theſe deſigns with a pretence of recovering what had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Crown. The ſame reaſon made him undertake the Conqueſt of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> which if once in her hands, would ſecure <hi>France</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> For the ſame conſideration likewiſe, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the King to get ſome place or other upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whatever it coſt him; and this made <hi>France,</hi> after the Death of the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> ſeize <hi>Briſac</hi> with that greedineſs. And it was for this proſpect alſo, that the King could never be brought to ſurrender <hi>Pignerol,</hi> that ſo he might be in a condition to act in <hi>Italy,</hi> whenever he pleaſed; for at that time he only made War there for the Reputation of his Crown, and for the Support of his Siſter and his Nephew, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> After he had employ'd <hi>Bellievre</hi> in vain, to engage the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in a League againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> he no longer thought of making any Conqueſts there, for it was his opinion, that ſuch an enterprize could not ſucceed, without the aſſiſtance of at leaſt one half of thoſe powers, between whom <hi>Italy</hi> is divided.</p>
               <p>A midſt theſe projects, relating to the Grandeur of the Crown, and to ſatisfye his own Ambition, he took care to provide himſelf a ſecure retreat, in caſe any misfortune ſhould oblige him to retire. For this end he always kept a conſiderable ſumm at <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> to ſerve him in time of neceſſity; nay, he had purchaſed a Soveraignty upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> by buying <hi>Chateau-Renaud</hi> in the King's name, and making himſelf Maſter of <hi>Charleville.</hi> He likewiſe cauſed a Royal Fort to be built at ſome diſtance from <hi>Sedan,</hi> upon a Mountain, with a deſign to make himſelf Maſter of that City, when time ſhould ſerve, and not incorporate it to the Crown. For this reaſon he forbore to attack it with all the Forces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the beginning of the troubles, raiſed by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> as otherwiſe he might have done. His deſign being to buy it for himſelf, ſo ſoon as he found a favourable opportunity.</p>
               <p>Setting this aſide, 'tis certain that he made the King abſolute Maſter of his dominions, by changing
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:54967:196"/>the Governments, which generally laſted for life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that ſo the reſpective Governours might not come to be too powerful; and by puniſhing Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſeverely; whereas the method formerly was to grant the Malecontents ſome rewards, in order to oblige them to lay down their arms. Under his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry he made no Treaty, by which any more was granted to thoſe that had raiſed any commotions, than a bare impunity; but he never permitted them to have the leaſt ſhare in public affairs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>By a ſtrong, a ſteady and equal conduct, he knew how to make the beſt advantage of all the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of that time, and turn'd the greateſt tempeſts into calms, where he peaceably enjoy'd the fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>its of his labours. In ſhort, after he had triumphed over his own private Enemies as well as thoſe of the State, he died in the higheſt pitch of glory, and in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary eſteem with his own Prince.</p>
